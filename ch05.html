<div class="hd0">Chapter 5: Link Verbs</div>

<p>In this book, we use the term <span class="bold">link verb</span> to refer to verbs like <span class="italics">be</span>, <span class="italics">become</span>, and <span class="italics">seem</span> which need to be followed by a Complement. Complements can be noun groups, adjective groups, adverb groups, prepositional phrases, or clauses. They describe the person or thing indicated by the Subject. Verbs of this kind have the label <span class="pattern">V-LINK</span> in the Collins Cobuild English Dictionary.</p>

<p>There are other verbs which are sometimes followed by Complements, but they are not generally considered to be link verbs because they have a complete meaning in themselves, for example they indicate an action such as moving or leaving. <r>These verbs are dealt with in Chapter 1, Sections 2 and 6 (see page xxx and pages xxx-xxx).</r></p>

<p>When verbs such as <span class="italics">be</span> and <span class="italics">stay</span> are followed by prepositional phrases and adverbs indicating place, they are not considered to be link verbs: <r>see page xxx</r> <i>Ch2 Sec1 mg 9</i>.</p>

<p>Some link verbs are used in various patterns with <span class="bold">introductory <span class="italics">it</span></span> as Subject: <r>see pages xxx-xxx</r>. <i>Ch9 Sec1</i></p>

<div class="hd2">Link verb meanings</div>

<p>Link verbs can be divided into three main meaning groups.</p>

<div class="hd5">1 The `be' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that a person or thing is something, or has a particular quality. The verb <span class="italics">be</span> is by far the most frequent of these. We include here <span class="italics">keep</span>, <span class="italics">remain</span>, and <span class="italics">stay</span>, which indicate that a person or thing remains something, or continues to have a particular quality.</p>

<p>A few of these verbs have passives. These are given in the list below.</p>

<div class="list"> average be compose be composed of comprise be comprised of constitute be constituted by/of cover equal extend feel form be formed by go keep lie make measure number pass prove rank rate remain represent be represented by stand stay total weigh</div>



<div class="list"> make up be made up of work out </div>

<p>A few verbs are used with the general meaning `be' only when talking about the level of share prices or currencies:</p>

<div class="list"> close end finish open </div>

<div class="hd5">2 The `become' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that a person or thing becomes something, or comes to have a particular quality.</p>

<div class="list"> come out come over end up finish up turn out wind up </div>

<p>A few verbs are used with the general meaning `become' only when talking about the level of share prices, currencies, or other amounts:</p>

<div class="list"> creep drift edge inch move </div>

<div class="hd5">3 The `seem' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that a person or thing seems to be something, or seems to have a particular quality. We include here <span class="italics">act</span> and <span class="italics">play</span>, which indicate that someone pretends to be something.</p>

<div class="list"> act appear feel look play seem smell sound taste </div>

<div class="hd2">Prepositional link verbs</div>

<p>The following combinations of verbs and prepositional phrases can be considered to be link verbs followed by Complements. <r>See the sections on <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">as</span> n</span>, <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">to</span> n</span>, etc in Chapter 2.</r></p>

<div class="list"> act as sth amount to sth begin as sth come to sth come as sth consist of sth consist in sth continue as sth convert into/to sth double as sth end as sth figure as sth finish as sth function as sth lie in sth masquerade as sth operate as sth originate as sth parade as sth pass as/for sth pose as sth serve as/for sth rank as sth rate as sth remain as sth reside in sth resolve into sth run at sth run into sth shade into/to sth stand at sth start as sth transmute into sth turn into/to sth</div>

<div class="hd2">Link verb patterns</div>

<p>Link verbs have the following patterns. Many of these patterns are dealt with in other chapters because they also occur with verbs that are not link verbs.</p>

<div class="hd3">1 V n</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a noun group.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">His father <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was</span> an accountant</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">felt</span> such a fool</span>.</span></li>

<span class="pg">452</span> <div class="hd3">2 V amount</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a word or phrase indicating an amount.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Twenty-four minus five <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span> nineteen</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Other related patterns are:</p>

<div class="hd3">3 V adj</div>

<p>The verb is followed by an adjective group.</p>

  <li><span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">looked</span> worried</span>.</span></li>

<div class="hd3">4 V to-inf</div>

<p>Some verbs which are link verbs are also followed by a to-infinitive, as in <span class="italics">She seemed to be looking for someone</span>. However, here the verbs are considered to be <span class="bold">in phase</span>, rather than to be a link verb and its Complement. <r>See page xxx.</r> <i>Ch1 Sec8 mg I.2.</i></p>

<div class="hd3">5 V as if, V as though</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a clause beginning with <span class="italics">as if</span>, <span class="italics">as though</span>, or, in informal English, <span class="italics">like</span>.</p>


<ul class="example">

</ul>
<r>See pages xxx-xxx.</r> <i>Chap1 Sec15.</i>

<div class="hd3">6 V prep</div>

</ul>
<r>See page xxx.</r> <i>Ch2 Sec23 mg 4.</i>

<div class="hd3">9 Clause as Complement</div>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">be</span> can be followed by a variety of clauses which identify the Subject. The Subject indicates something abstract such as a problem or an aim. This structure is often used to focus on a fact or situation.</p>

<p>These patterns are <span class="pattern">V -ing</span>, <span class="pattern">V to-inf</span>, <span class="pattern">V that</span>, <span class="pattern">V wh</span>, and <span class="pattern">V wh-to-inf</span>.

</ul>
<div class="list"> be become remain </div>

<div class="hd3">10 V compl to n</div>

<p>With verbs meaning `seem', a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span> is sometimes used after the Complement to indicate or emphasize whose viewpoint you are giving.</p>

<span class="pg">454</span> These patterns are <span class="pattern">V adj/n <span class="italics">to</span> n</span> and <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">like</span> n <span class="italics">to</span> n</span>.




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">It <span class="bold"><span class="underline">sounds</span> crazy to me</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Life <span class="bold"><span class="underline">seemed</span> a great joke to her</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">didn't look</span> like a fisherman to me</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span> comes directly after the verb.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">This is a situation which <span class="bold"><span class="underline">seems</span> to me extraordinary</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">11 Link verbs used without a following Complement</div>

<p>Verbs meaning `seem' can be used by themselves, without a following Complement, in comparative clauses beginning with <span class="italics">as</span> or <span class="italics">than</span>. This structure is used when you are making a comparison between what someone or something appears to be like and what they are really like.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He is much more astute than he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">seems</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">This is not as simple as it <span class="bold"><span class="underline">sounds</span></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The verb <span class="italics">be</span> is used by itself in comparative clauses, and also when confirming or contradicting a statement and in short answers to questions.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He's smarter than I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">am</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`Pat Norton is your brother-in-law?' `Yes, he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span></span>.'</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="italics">Be</span> is also used to form question tags, which ask the hearer or reader to confirm a statement. The verb follows a clause and is followed by a noun group, which is its Subject.



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">You're not from here, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">are</span></span> you?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">It's very difficult, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">isn't</span></span> it?</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="italics">Be</span> is also used after <span class="italics">so, nor</span>, or <span class="italics">neither</span> to indicate a situation that is similar to one mentioned in a previous clause. The verb is followed by a noun group, which is its Subject.



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">They're strong, yes, but so <span class="bold"><span class="underline">are</span></span> we.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`I'm not worried about Mrs Parfitt.' `Neither <span class="bold"><span class="underline">am</span></span> I.'</span></li>
</ul>
