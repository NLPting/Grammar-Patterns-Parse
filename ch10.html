<div class="hd0">Chapter 10: Patterns with <span class="italics">there</span></div>

<p>There are two verb patterns that begin with the word <span class="italics">there</span>. Like <span class="bold">introductory <span class="italics">it</span></span>, <span class="italics">there</span> does not carry any meaning in these patterns. English prefers to have old information at the beginning of a clause and new information at the end of a clause. If a clause does not contain any old information, having <span class="italics">there</span> at the beginning allows all the new information to be placed at the end of a clause. For example, the clause <span class="italics">There were lizards on the floor</span> has two pieces of new information: <span class="italics">lizards</span> and <span class="italics">on the floor</span>. You could say <span class="italics">Some lizards were on the floor</span>, but then some of the new information would be at the beginning of the clause. In the clause beginning with <span class="italics">there</span>, none of the new information comes at the beginning of the clause.</p>

<p>There are two ways of forming a negative in patterns with <span class="italics">there</span>. The verb may be made negative, for example with <span class="italics">not</span>, or the noun group may be made negative, for example with <span class="italics">no</span>. You can say <span class="italics">There wasn't any evidence</span> or <span class="italics">There was no evidence.</span></p>

<p>The two patterns beginning with <span class="italics">there</span> are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Pattern I: <span class="italics">there</span> V n<br/><span class="italics">There <span class="underline">was</span> no hope</span>.</li> </li>
 <li>Pattern II: <span class="italics">there</span> V n prep/adv<br/><span class="italics">There <span class="underline">are</span> dangers here.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">be</span> is by far the most frequent of the verbs that have these patterns.</p>

<div class="hd2">Pattern I: <span class="italics">there</span> V n</div>

<p>The verb follows <span class="italics">there</span> and is followed by a noun group.</p>

<p>The noun group is the Subject. It agrees in number with the verb group: if the noun group is singular, the verb group is singular, and if the noun group is plural, the verb group is plural. However, if the noun group is a co-ordinated noun group, the verb group remains singular, as in <span class="italics">There <span class="underline">is</span> a computer, a printer, and a photo-copying machine.</span></p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">there</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Adjunct (optional)</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">appeared</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">a completely new problem.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">was</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">no moon</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that night.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">remain</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">deep differences.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">seems</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">little hope of success.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr></table>



<p>The noun group is usually indefinite: it begins with a determiner such as <span class="italics">a</span> or <span class="italics">some</span>, or a quantifier such as <span class="italics">any</span> or <span class="italics">a few</span>. If the noun group is plural, there is often no determiner at all. When the noun group is definite, beginning with a determiner such as <span class="italics">the</span>, this may be for one of three reasons:</p>

<p>1 It is used to change to a topic that is new in the conversation or writing but already known to the hearer or reader. The sentence often begins with <span class="italics">And, Firstly</span>, or <span class="italics">Then</span>.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">And then <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">is</span> the leadership crisis</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>2 It is used when the noun group must be definite, for example because it includes a superlative adjective.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">You have to send your horses where <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">are</span> the best opportunities</span> and that often means overseas.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">562</span> 3 It is used with <span class="italics">always</span> to indicate that something good or bad may happen, or that the hearer or reader has the opportunity to do something.




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Be positive. <span class="bold">There <span class="underline">is</span> always the chance that it may get better</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">is</span> always the risk of a more serious injury</span> if you use a spray.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">And, of course, <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">is</span> always the `off' button</span>. You can always turn the television off.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In this pattern the noun group often includes a clause such as a relative clause, a that-clause, or a to-infinitive clause, or an adjective group following the noun. When the head of the noun group is a pronoun such as <span class="italics">enough, little</span>, or <span class="italics">more</span>, there is usually a clause following the pronoun.</p>









<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Granted <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">are</span> a great many who are extremely lean and wiry</span>, but others can certainly become overweight.  </span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Are</span> there any exercises that will achieve this</span>?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">They get pleasure from the thought that <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">are</span> whales swimming freely about</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">In every love affair or marriage <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">comes</span> a time when romance abates and only compatibility, affection, generosity and goodwill hold it all together</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">And <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">are</span> signs that the richer nations are waking up to the broader problem</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">was</span> something strange about the flickering blue light</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">are</span> only 100 places available</span>, so book now.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">is</span> never enough to go round</span> and tempers are frayed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The noun group may be the `-ing' form of a verb. In this case, it is always negative.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There<span class="underline">'s</span> no denying that beautiful make-up looks better on beautiful skin</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
</table>

<div class="hd5">I.1 The `be' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with something existing or something happening. We include here <span class="italics">follow</span>, which indicates that something happens after something else.</p>







<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Thousands are wounded. Yet <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">appears</span> little early prospect of a mass evacuation</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Was</span> there any genuine prejudice</span>?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Although <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">is</span> no certain evidence to prove the origins of Gypsies</span>, the earliest are usually thought to have moved westwards from India about nine centuries ago.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">exist</span> some absolute limits to what human beings can know about their surroundings</span>.  </span></li>

  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">remains</span> one difficulty: how to describe the new wines from South Africa</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>The verb <span class="italics">seem</span> is usually followed by a noun group beginning with <span class="italics">little</span> or <span class="italics">no</span>, or with the pronoun <span class="italics">nothing</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">seems</span> little point in adopting a different system</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> appear be exist follow occur remain seem </div>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">be</span> is often used with a modal verb such as <span class="italics">may</span>, with a <span class="bold">phrasal modal verb</span> such as <span class="italics">be bound to</span> or <span class="italics">be supposed to</span> (<r>see Chapter 11</r>), or with a phrase with an adjective group such as <span class="italics">be certain/likely/sure/unlikely to</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">was bound to be</span> an increase in job losses</span>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There was certain to <span class="underline">be</span> speculation</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">563</span> <n>The to-infinitive form of the verb <span class="italics">be</span> is often used following a verb such as <span class="italics">appear, continue, happen, need, seem</span>, or <span class="italics">tend</span>, or following the passive of a verb such as <span class="italics">believe, estimate, expect, know, reckon, report, rumour, say, see, think</span>, or <span class="italics">understand</span>. The two verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span> and form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. The to-infinitive form of the verb <span class="italics">exist</span> is sometimes used with <span class="italics">appear</span> and <span class="italics">seem</span>.</n>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There appeared <span class="underline">to be</span> no progress following today's talks</span>. </span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There are reckoned <span class="underline">to be</span> thirty-seven different groups</span>.</span></li>

  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There seems <span class="underline">to exist</span> a large and impressive body of evidence that points to reincarnation</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd5">I.2 The `emerge' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with something coming into existence or starting to be seen.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Then <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">appear</span> a number of teachers with circles of devotees and students</span>.</span></li>

  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">emerges</span> a picture of a woman who cares deeply for her man</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> appear arise come develop emerge grow</div>



<div class="list"> grow up </div>

<div class="hd2">Pattern II: <span class="italics">there</span> V n prep/adv</div>

<p>The verb follows <span class="italics">there</span> and is followed by a noun group. There is also a prepositional phrase or adverb group which usually comes after the noun group. Most of these verbs also have the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">there</span> V n</span>.</p>

<p>The noun group is the Subject and the prepositional phrase or adverb group is an Adjunct.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">there</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">prep. phrase or adverb group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Adjunct</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">was</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">no one</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">there.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">occurs</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">discord</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">in the marriage.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">There</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">remained</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">a risk</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">in such a situation.</td></tr></table>



<p>Sometimes the prepositional phrase or adverb group comes before <span class="italics">there</span>, as in <span class="italics">For every action there <span class="underline">is</span> an equal and opposite reaction</span>, or after the verb, as in <span class="italics">There <span class="underline">was</span> in the flat an ancient wood-burning stove</span>.</p>

<p>The noun group is usually indefinite: if it is singular it begins with a determiner such as <span class="italics">a</span> or <span class="italics">some</span>, or a quantifier such as <span class="italics">any</span> or <span class="italics">a few</span>. If the noun group is plural, there is often no determiner at all, as the clause <span class="italics">There are schools that will have to close</span>.</p>

<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
</table>

<div class="hd5">II.1 The `be' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with something existing or something happening. This is a productive use: any verb which indicates where someone or something is, or how they move, can be used with this pattern, for example <span class="italics">Near our camp there <span class="underline">flowed</span> a beautiful stream</span>. We include in the list here those verbs, such as <span class="italics">lie</span> and <span class="italics">stand</span>, which are most frequently used in this way.</p>

<span class="pg">564</span> <span class="example">I just think <span class="bold">there <span class="underline">are</span> great sources of pain in everyone</span>. </span>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">In Brighton there <span class="underline">exists</span> an ancient custom of playing a Boxing Day game of bowls using oranges</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">seemed</span> a note of venom in what he said</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">lie, stand</span>, and other verbs used productively in this way, the prepositional phrase or adverb group usually comes immediately after the verb or at the beginning of the clause, rather than after the noun group.</n>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">lay</span> between them something unspoken</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">At one end of the room there <span class="underline">stood</span> a grand piano</span>. </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> be exist lie occur remain seem stand </div>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">be</span> is often used with a modal verb, such as <span class="italics">may</span>, with a phrasal modal, such as <span class="italics">be bound to</span> or <span class="italics">be supposed to</span>, or with a phrase with an adjective group, such as <span class="italics">be certain/likely/sure/unlikely to</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There <span class="underline">may be</span> a deeper truth here</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There<span class="underline">'s supposed to be</span> a state of emergency in the city</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The to-infinitive form of the verb <span class="italics">be</span> is often used following <span class="italics">appear</span> or <span class="italics">seem</span>, or following the passive of a verb such as <span class="italics">believe, estimate, expect, know, reckon, report, rumour, say, see, think</span>, or <span class="italics">understand</span>. The two verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span> and form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There appeared <span class="underline">to be</span> a woman in the car</span>, accompanied by a man.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">There were reported <span class="underline">to be</span> wounded on both sides</span>.</span></li>
