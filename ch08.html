<div class="hd0">Chapter 8: Ergative Reciprocal Verbs</div>

<p>There are some verbs which are both <span class="bold">ergative</span> and <span class="bold">reciprocal</span>. Verbs of this kind have the label <span class="pattern">V-RECIP-ERG</span> in the Collins Cobuild English Dictionary.</p>

<p>A typical ergative reciprocal verb has the following features:</p>

<p>1 Like an ergative verb, it has both patterns where the verb is not followed directly by a noun group (for example <span class="pattern">pl-n V</span> and <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>) and patterns where the verb is followed directly by a noun group (for example <span class="pattern">V pl-n</span> and <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>). The person or thing indicated by the Subject of the first kind of pattern may also be indicated by the noun group following the verb in the second kind of pattern. For example: <span class="italics">The oil <span class="underline">mixes</span> with the other ingredients</span>; <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">mixed</span> the oil with the other ingredients.</span></p>

<p>2 Like a reciprocal verb, it has a pattern where the verb is used with a plural Subject indicating the participants in an action (for example <span class="pattern">pl-n V</span>), and one or more patterns where one participant is indicated by the Subject and the other is indicated by the Object, prepositional Object, or Adjunct (for example <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>). For example: <span class="italics">The salt water and fresh water <span class="underline">mix</span></span>; <span class="italics">The salt water <span class="underline">mixes</span> with the fresh water.</span></p>

<p>Ergative reciprocal verbs all indicate that two or more people, groups, or things join together or are linked in some way, or that someone or something causes two or more people, groups, or things to join together or be linked.</p>

<div class="hd1">Pattern combinations</div>

<p>An ergative reciprocal verb has one of these three pattern combinations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Pattern combination 1: pl-n V; V <span class="italics">with</span> n; V pl-n; V n <span class="italics">with</span> n<br/><span class="italics">The liquids <span class="underline">will blend</span> to make a rich sauce.</span> <span class="italics">The chocolate <span class="underline">blends</span> with the coffee.</span> <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Blend</span> the remaining ingredients.</span> <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Blend</span> the butter with the sugar.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>*Pattern combination 2: V; pl-n V n; V n <span class="italics">with</span> n<br/><span class="italics">The peace talks <span class="underline">will reopen</span> tomorrow.</span> <span class="italics">The two groups <span class="underline">reopened</span> talks yesterday.</span> <span class="italics">They <span class="underline">have reopened</span> negotiations with the government.</span></li></p>

<p>*Pattern combination 3: pl-n V; V n; V pl-n; V n <span class="italics">to/with</span> n<br/><span class="italics">The chairs all <span class="underline">matched</span>.</span> <span class="italics">Her hat <span class="underline">matched</span> her coat.</span> <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Match</span> the two lengths of cloth.</span> <span class="italics">We <span class="underline">will match</span> the fabric to your existing furnishing.</span></li> </nl></p>

<div class="hd2">Pattern combination 1: pl-n V; V <span class="italics">with</span> n; V pl-n; V n <span class="italics">with</span> n</div>

<p>These verbs have four patterns. Two patterns are reciprocal:</p>

<li> <span class="pattern">pl-n V</span>: The verb is used with a plural Subject.</li> <span class="pg">511</span> <br/>* <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>: The verb is used with a Subject indicating one participant and is followed by a prepositional phrase indicating the other. In most cases, the prepositional phrase consists of <span class="italics">with</span> and a noun group; in a few cases, the preposition is <span class="italics">from</span>, <span class="italics">to</span>, or <span class="italics">against</span>.

<p>Two patterns are not reciprocal:</p>

<li> <span class="pattern">V pl-n</span>: The verb is followed by a <span class="bold">plural noun group</span>.</li> <br/>* <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>: The verb is followed by a noun group and a prepositional phrase. In most cases, the prepositional phrase consists of <span class="italics">with</span> and a noun group; in a few cases, the preposition is <span class="italics">from</span>, <span class="italics">to</span>, or <span class="italics">against</span>.

<p>There are five verbs with this combination of patterns. The verbs <span class="italics">match</span> and <span class="italics">overlap</span> have the pattern <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>. The verbs <span class="italics">marry</span>, <span class="italics">match</span> and <span class="italics">touch</span> have the pattern <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">to</span> n</span>.</p>

<div class="hd2">Emphasizing reciprocity</div>

<p>When ergative reciprocal verbs are used in patterns with a plural Subject, they can be emphasized with phrases in the same way as ordinary reciprocal verbs (<r>see Chapter 6</r>). With most of them, a <span class="bold">reciprocal pronoun</span> (<span class="italics">each other</span> or <span class="italics">one another</span>) can be used after the appropriate preposition or after the verb.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The third possibility is that <span class="bold">building societies <span class="underline">may merge</span> with each other</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">These muscles <span class="underline">overlap</span> each other</span>.</span>   With the verbs listed below, the adverb <span class="italics">together</span> can be used for emphasis.</li>
  <li><span class="example">Given enough speed, <span class="bold">nuclei <span class="underline">fuse</span> together</span> and make a new, heavier element.</span></li>
