<div class="hd0">Chapter 3: Complex Patterns</div>

<p>In this chapter we describe complex verb patterns in which the verb is followed by a noun group and another element, such as another noun group, an adjective group, a that-clause, or a wh-clause. Patterns in which the verb is followed by a noun group and a prepositional phrase or adverb group are described in Chapter 4.</p>

<a name="s01"/>
<div class="hd1">1 V n n</div>

<div class="st">The verb is followed by two noun groups. The passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed n.</span></div>

<p>This pattern has three main structures:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Structure I: Verb with two Objects<br/><span class="italics">He <span class="underline">gave</span> her a present.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Structure II: Verb with Object and Object Complement<br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">appointed</span> him chairman.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Structure III: Verb with Object and Adjunct<br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">won</span> the game 4-2.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Verbs with this structure belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
<tr><td>I.1 The `give' group </td><td>I.3 The `tell' and `send' group </td><td>I.5 The `envy' group </td></tr>
<tr><td>I.2 The `bring' group </td><td>I.4 The `cost' and `save' group </td><td>I.6 Verbs with other meanings </lb></lb></lb></lb></lb></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="hd5">I.1 The `give' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with giving someone something, or refusing to do so. This includes:</p>

<ul>
 <li> giving or selling e.g. <span class="italics">award, sell</span></li> <li> lending e.g. <span class="italics">lend, loan</span></li> <li> bequeathing e.g. <span class="italics">bequeath, leave</span></li> <li> transferring e.g. <span class="italics">hand, pass</span></li> <li> allocating or committing money or resources e.g. <span class="italics">allocate, allot</span></li> <li> allocating tasks or responsibilities e.g. <span class="italics">assign</span></li> <li> promising e.g. <span class="italics">promise</span></li> <li> offering e.g. <span class="italics">offer, proffer</span></li> <li> not giving e.g. <span class="italics">deny, refuse</span></li> <li> showing e.g. <span class="italics">show</span></li>
</ul>

<span class="pg">274</span> We also include here more abstract verbs like <span class="italics">give</span> (someone a certain impression), <span class="italics">pay</span> (someone a visit), and <span class="italics">permit</span>.








<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The best way to instil in Leo a sense of discipline will be to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">allot</span> him some specific task which allows him to express his excellent organizing ability.</span> </span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Each patient <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is assigned</span> a psychiatrist from the pool of psychiatrists at McLean Hospital.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">A cloud suddenly blocked out the moon, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">denying</span> him his only source of light.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">That year for Christmas my parents <span class="bold"><span class="underline">gave</span> me a microscope kit</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He told her that he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was not going to leave</span> her anything</span> in his will.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Take the goods back to the retailer who <span class="bold"><span class="underline">will refund</span> you the purchase price.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The club's representative had arranged to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">sell</span> him a ticket for the match.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<n>The phrasal verbs in this group have the patterns <span class="pattern">V n n P</span> and <span class="pattern">V n P n</span>. When they have the pattern <span class="pattern">V n P n</span>, the second noun group cannot be a personal pronoun.  You say <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">paid</span> him <span class="underline">back</span> the money</span> but you do not say <span class="italics">She paid him back it</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">gave</span> me <span class="bold">back</span> my ring</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">permit 4</span>, the noun group following the verb is always a reflexive pronoun. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V pron-refl n</span>.</n> The verb <span class="italics">deny</span> often has this pattern as well.


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Bob must have enjoyed it too, because he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">permitted</span> himself a fleeting smile</span> at the end.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">offer 9, pay 1,2,4</span>, and <span class="italics">tip</span>, the second noun group is always or often an <span class="bold">amount</span>. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V n amount.</span></n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">They brought in an American star and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">paid</span> him three million pounds plus expenses.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<div class="list"> give back hand back pay back </div>

<p>When the verbs in this meaning group have a prepositional pattern, it is usually <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">to</span> n</span>, as in <span class="italics">I gave the present to her</span> (<r>see page xxx).</r> <i>Ch4 Sec24</i></p>

<p>These verbs are concerned with doing something for someone, usually something which is beneficial to them. The noun group following the verb indicates the person or people involved. These verbs are not often used in the passive.</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with two Objects</div>

<p>a) Both the noun group following the verb and the second noun group are Objects.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed n</span>. The noun group is the Object. Either the first or the second Object of the active clause may be the Subject of the passive clause, though in most cases the human being is the Subject.  Clauses like <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">was offered</span> a job</span> are more frequent than clauses like <span class="italics">A job <span class="italics">was offered</span> me.</span></p>

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same, except that there also is a particle, P, which comes after the first Object, or after both Objects. Some phrasal verbs have restricted patterning, and these restrictions are mentioned under the meaning groups concerned.</p>

<span class="pg">277</span> d) The pattern <span class="pattern">V n amount</span> has two passives, with the patterns <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed n</span> and <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed amount</span>. In most cases, however, the human being is the Subject, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed amount</span>. Clauses like <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">was owed</span> a lot</span> are more frequent than clauses like <span class="italics">A lot <span class="underline">was owed</span> me.</span>

<p>Verbs with this structure belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
</table>

<div class="hd5">I.1 The `like' group</div>

<p>These verbs are all concerned with liking, wanting, or needing someone or something to have a particular quality or to be in a particular state. The adjective indicates that quality or state.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The Dutch spread jam on bread for breakfast, so they <span class="bold"><span class="underline">like</span> it smooth.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I wanted the house to have a lived-in feel, but I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">wanted</span> it elegant, not too rustic.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> like need prefer want wish </div>

<span class="pg">281</span> <div class="hd5">I.2 The `imagine' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with imagining someone or something to have a particular quality or to be in a particular state. The adjective indicates that quality or state.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">No-one <span class="bold"><span class="underline">imagined</span> her capable of having an affair.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> imagine picture </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object</div>

<p>a) The noun group and the adjective group together form the Object: they cannot be separated from each other. In the first example in the table above, what <span class="italics">he <span class="underline">preferred</span></span> was his <span class="italics">fish</span> to be <span class="italics">unfilleted</span>; he did not <span class="italics">prefer his fish</span>. With this structure you can ask the question <span class="italics">What did he prefer?</span>, which makes it clear that <span class="italics">his fish unfilleted</span> is a single grammatical unit.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>These verbs are concerned with:</p>

<ul>
 <li> considering, declaring, judging, or proving someone or something to have a particular quality e.g. <span class="italics">deem, pronounce</span></li> <span class="pg">282</span> <li> naming or labelling someone or something in a particular way e.g. <span class="italics">call, label</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The adjective indicates the quality someone or something is considered to have or what they are called.</p>







<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The journal `Nature' <span class="bold"><span class="underline">called</span> this book dangerous.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">We are no longer bound to the view that the earth is the immobile center of the universe, nor even <span class="bold"><span class="underline">do</span></span> we <span class="bold"><span class="bold">consider</span> it stationary.</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p>Some of these verbs are used only with a very restricted range of adjectives; for example <span class="italics">hold</span> is used only with <span class="italics">accountable</span>, <span class="italics">liable</span>, and <span class="italics">responsible</span>.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">They <span class="bold"><span class="underline">held</span> him responsible for the brutal treatment they endured and the inhuman conditions they suffered during their detention.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object and Object Complement</div>

<p>a) The noun group is the Object, and the adjective group is the Object Complement.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed adj</span>. The adjective group is the Complement.</p>

<p>c) The adjective group usually comes after the noun group.  Sometimes, however, the adjective group comes before the noun group, especially when the noun group is a long one. This applies particularly to the group of verbs associated with <span class="italics">open</span> and <span class="italics">shut</span>: <br/><span class="italics">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">yanked</span> open a drawer of one filing cabinet</span>, and pulled out a magazine.</span></p>

<p>d) Phrasal verb patterns are the same, except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the Object. There are only three phrasal verbs with this structure, <span class="italics">turn down, turn up</span>, and <span class="italics">crank up</span>. The active pattern is <span class="pattern">V n P adj</span>, and the passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed P adj</span>.</p>

<p>These verbs are concerned with trying to make someone do something, usually by talking to them. This includes more pleasant ways of persuasion, such as <span class="italics">cajole</span> and <span class="italics">coax</span>, as well as more unpleasant ways, such as <span class="italics">badger</span> and <span class="italics">pester</span>.</p>

<p>a) Both the noun group and the to-infinitive clause are Objects.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed to-inf</span>. The to-infinitive clause is the Object.

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same, except that there is also a particle, P. The first Object comes either between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. When this Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">The court <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can bind</span> them <span class="bold">over</span> to control the offender</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">The court <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can bind over</span> parents to control the offender</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">The court can bind over them to control the offender.</span></p>

<n>In the case of <span class="italics">let 4,5,6,7,8,9,13</span>, the noun group is always <span class="italics">me</span> or <span class="italics">us</span>. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">me/us</span> inf</span>. The verb is imperative.</n>


<ul class="example">

</ul>
<div class="list"> bid have let make </div>

<div class="hd5">3 The `help' group</div>

<p>This group consists of three senses of the verb <span class="italics">help</span>.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Knowledgeable, friendly staff <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can help</span> you make your choice from the hundreds of different rings available.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> help </div>

<span class="pg">299</span> <div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) Both the noun group and the infinitive clause are Objects.</p>

<p>b) Most of the verbs with this structure have no exact passive equivalent: when these verbs are passive, they behave like the verbs in Structure II of <span class="pattern">V n to-inf</span>; that is, the to-infinitive is used, and the pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed to-inf</span>, as in the clause <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">was seen</span> to hit out with his whip.</span></p>

<p>There are some exceptions to this.  <span class="italics">Let</span> has a passive with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed inf</span>. This is not very frequent, and is used mainly with <span class="italics">go</span>: <br/><span class="italics">His few opponents <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can</span></span> safely <span class="bold"><span class="bold">be let</span> go.</span></span> <br/>The other exceptions are <span class="italics">have, notice</span>, and <span class="italics">watch</span>, which have no passive at all in this sense.</p>

<n>The verbs <span class="italics">decide</span> and <span class="italics">tell 8</span> always have an inanimate Subject, and are not used in the passive.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">All other indicators <span class="bold"><span class="underline">tell</span> us that our customers are more satisfied now with our service than they have ever been</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>The verbs <span class="italics">convince, remind, show</span>, and <span class="italics">teach</span> sometimes have an inanimate Subject.</n>

<span class="pg">300</span> <span class="example">By the time he was eighteen years old, something happened which <span class="bold"><span class="underline">convinced</span> him that he was destined for great things</span>.</span>

<n>In the case of the following verbs, the noun group is always or often a reflexive pronoun: <span class="italics">assure, console, convince, delude, flatter, kid, persuade, promise, reassure, remind, satisfy, tell</span>. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V pron-refl that</span>. These verbs indicate that someone has or acquires a particular idea or thought, often a comforting or confident one.</n>




<ul class="example">

<n>In the case of <span class="italics">lay</span>, the noun group is always <span class="italics">money</span> or <span class="italics">odds</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The sky's the limit and I<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'d lay</span> money he will go on to play for England</span></span>.</li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">hit</span> and <span class="italics">strike</span>, the that-clause qualifies the noun <span class="italics">thought</span> rather than being part of a true verb pattern.</n>


<ul class="example">
