<div class="hd0">Chapter 12: Combinations of Patterns</div>

<p>Many verbs have more than one pattern. For example, <span class="italics">boast</span> has the patterns <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n</span> and <span class="pattern">V that</span>; you can boast about something you have done, or boast that you have done something. Verbs that have the same basic meaning may also share a combination of patterns. For example, <span class="italics">argue</span> and <span class="italics">complain</span>, like <span class="italics">boast</span>, have the patterns <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n</span> and <span class="pattern">V that</span>.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we give the most important combinations of patterns. The patterns in each pattern combination are ordered alphabetically, so, for example, we give the combination <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">in</span> n; V <span class="italics">on</span> n</span>, not the combination <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">on</span> n; V <span class="italics">in</span> n</span>. Under each pattern combination, we give examples showing both patterns, and a list of the verbs which have that combination of patterns. The examples indicate whether the two patterns perform a similar function, as in <span class="italics">argue about something</span> and <span class="italics">argue over something</span>, or whether they perform different functions, as in <span class="italics">campaign against something</span> and <span class="italics">campaign for something</span>. We sometimes give two examples of one pattern, to show its two possible meanings with a particular verb. The verbs in one combination of patterns may all have the same basic meaning, or they may have different meanings: for example, some of the verbs with the combination <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">at</span> n; V n <span class="italics">at</span> n</span> are concerned with shouting, and some with pointing.</p>

<p>The pattern combinations themselves are also presented in alphabetical order. For example, <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">in</span> n; V n <span class="italics">in</span> n</span> comes before <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">in</span> n; V <span class="italics">on</span> n</span>. If you know which combination of patterns you want to look at, you can find it in its alphabetical place. If, on the other hand, you are interested in, for example, any combination of patterns with <span class="pattern">V that</span>, look up <span class="pattern">V that</span> in its normal alphabetical place: you will find some combinations there, and cross-references to the other combinations.</p>

<p>Although most of the combinations we give involve two patterns, the combinations of three and four patterns are particularly interesting. In this chapter you will find the following combinations of three patterns:</p>

<span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n; V <span class="italics">at</span> n; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n; V <span class="italics">on</span> n; V <span class="italics">over</span> n</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n; V <span class="italics">over</span> n; V that</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n; V that; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n; V wh; V wh-to-inf</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">against</span> n; V <span class="italics">for</span> n; V <span class="italics">in favour of</span> n</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">at</span> n; V that; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">for</span> n; V that; V to-inf</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">about</span> n; V n wh; V n wh-to-inf</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> n</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> n; V n n</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">as</span> adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> n; V n n</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">into</span> -ing; V n <span class="italics">into</span> n; V n to-inf</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n to-inf; V n with quote; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n to-inf; V that; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V n with quote; V that; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">on</span> n; V that; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V that; V to-inf; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V that; V <span class="italics">to</span> n; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V that; V wh; V with quote</span> <br/><span class="pattern">V that; V <span class="italics">with</span> n; V with quote</span>

<span class="pg">577</span>

<p>There is one combination of four patterns: <span class="pattern">V n adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> n; V n n</span> </p>

<p>The patterns <span class="pattern">V</span> and <span class="pattern">V n</span> are particularly frequent, and very many verbs that have other patterns also have the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span> or <span class="pattern">V n</span>. For example, <span class="italics">boast</span>, <span class="italics">argue</span>, and <span class="italics">complain</span> have the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span> as well as <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">about</span> n</span> and <span class="pattern">V that</span>. We do not show combinations with <span class="pattern">V</span> or <span class="pattern">V n</span>, except for the combination <span class="pattern">V; V n</span> itself.</p>

<div class="hd2">V; V n</div>

<p>The examples and list below contain only verbs which are among the 400 most frequently occurring verbs in the Bank of English. Many verbs that have the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span> and <span class="pattern">V n</span> are <span class="bold">ergative verbs</span>, for example <span class="italics">A window <span class="underline">broke</span>, They <span class="italics">broke</span> the window.</span> These verbs are not listed or examplified here but are described in Chapter 7.</p>
