<a name="s01"/>
<div class="hd1">1 V prep/adv, V adv/prep</div>

<div class="st"> The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with a variety of prepositions, or an adverb group. Some verbs listed here are also included in sections relating to verbs followed by specific prepositions.

<p>Here we treat all verbs with this pattern as having one structure:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Verb with Adjunct<br/><span class="italics">He <span class="underline">ran</span> across the road.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Some verbs with some prepositions have other structures, however. For example, some prepositional phrases beginning with <span class="italics">into</span> are prepositional Objects and some prepositional phrases beginning with <span class="italics">as</span> are prepositional Complements.</p>

<p>Most verbs in English can be followed by Adjuncts of manner, time, or place. When information about manner, time, or place is not essential, the Adjunct is not part of the pattern. The verbs dealt with below are those which are always or typically followed by an Adjunct.</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The prepositional phrase or adverb group is usually an Adjunct, although some prepositional phrases are prepositional Objects or prepositional Complements.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed prep</span> (<span class="pattern">prep</span> here means a preposition, not a prepositional phrase). However, it does not often occur. Usually there can be a passive structure only with one or two particular prepositions. The Subject refers to something directly affected by or involved in the action. <br/><span class="italics">Even old and venerable rugs <span class="bold"><span class="underline">are walked</span> on</span> by all and sundry.</span> <br/><span class="italics">The cottage <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has not been lived</span> in</span> for several years.</span></p>

<div class="list"> jump (on) leap (on/upon) live (in) look (at) peer (at) sit (on) stand (on) stare (at) step (on) walk (on/over/through) </div>

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb. The passive pattern, <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed P prep</span>, does not often occur.</p>

<div class="hd2">Other related patterns</div>

<div class="hd3">V adv prep</div>

<p>Most verbs with the pattern <span class="pattern">V prep/adv</span> also have the pattern <span class="pattern">V adv prep</span>. The verb is followed by an adverb and a prepositional phrase.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">They got into the lorries which were waiting for them and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">drove</span> off into the forest</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">walked</span> over to his desk</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">V prep prep</div>

<div class="hd3">V prep/adv n</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase or an adverb group, which is followed by a noun group describing the Subject. This is a productive pattern: many verbs of movement can be used in this way.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">You<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'re going</span> out a youngster</span>, but you<span class="bold"><span class="bold">'ve got to come</span> back a star</span>.</span></li>

<div class="hd1">2 V adv</div>

<div class="st"> The verb is followed by an adverb group.

<p>This pattern has one structure:</p>

<p>Most verbs can be followed by adverbs of manner or place. When information about manner or place is not essential, the adverb group is not part of the pattern. The verbs dealt with below are the ones which are always or typically followed by a particular adverb or small group of adverbs.</p>

<p>Many verbs which can be followed by an adverb group can also be followed by a variety of prepositions. These verbs are dealt with in <r>Section 1 above</r>. Verbs which can also be followed by one or two specific prepositions are dealt with in the sections on verbs followed by individual prepositions (<r>Sections 5 to 33 below</r>), as well as in this section.</p>

<p>Verbs with the pattern <span class="pattern">V adv</span> belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) If the prepositional phrase indicates something that is directly affected by or involved in an action, it is considered to be a prepositional Object. If it indicates the circumstances of an action, it is considered to be an Adjunct. Verbs with the pattern <span class="pattern">V prep</span> are followed by three or more different prepositions, and in some cases the prepositional phrase may be an Adjunct or a prepositional Object, depending on the preposition.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed prep</span> (<span class="pattern">prep</span> here means a preposition, not a prepositional phrase). However, it does not often occur. Usually there can be a passive structure for a verb only with one or two particular prepositions. The Subject refers to something directly affected by or involved in the action. <br/><span class="italics">The proposals <span class="bold"><span class="underline">are</span></span> still <span class="bold"><span class="bold">being worked</span> on</span>.</span></p>

<p>The following verbs from the lists above are the ones most frequently used in the passive, with the preposition(s) indicated.</p>

<div class="list"> adjudicate (on) compete (for) drool (over) gob (at) grieve (for) gush (over) hack (at) rummage (through) speculate (on/upon/about) spit (on/at) vote (on/for) work (on/at/for) </div>

<p>c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb. The passive pattern does not often occur.</p>




<a name="s05"/>
<div class="hd1">5 V <span class="italics">about</span> n</div>

<div class="st"> The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase which consists of the preposition <span class="italics">about</span> and a noun group. With most verbs, the preposition is sometimes followed by an `-ing' clause or a wh-clause. In Structure I, the preposition is followed by an `-ing' form. The passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">about</span></span>.

<p>This pattern has three structures:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Structure I: Verbs in phase<br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Don't bother</span> about clearing up.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Structure II: Verb with prepositional Object<br/><span class="italics">He <span class="underline">was grumbling</span> about the weather.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Structure III: Verb with Adjunct<br/><span class="italics">David <span class="underline">rang</span> about the meeting tomorrow.</span></li>
</ul>

<span class="pg">146</span> <div class="hd3">Structure I: Verbs in phase</div>

<div class="hd4">V <span class="italics">about</span> -ing</div>

<p>There are only two verbs with this structure. They are concerned with not doing something.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">As the Indians <span class="bold"><span class="underline">did not bother</span> about digging</span> very deep graves, many skeletons had been found.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> (not) bother forget </div>

<p>When the preposition <span class="italics">about</span> is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure II <r>(see meaning groups II.2 and II.4 below).</r></p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by the preposition <span class="italics">about</span> and the `-ing' form of another verb. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if someone is told to <span class="italics">forget about getting</span> something, the <span class="italics">forgetting</span> and the <span class="italics">not getting</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure table above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with prepositional Object</div>

<p>a) The prepositional phrase is the prepositional Object.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">at</span></span>. However, not all verbs with this structure are used in the passive. The following verbs are the ones which are most frequently passive.</p>

<div class="list"> fire guess hint laugh look marvel scoff shoot sneer sniff stare swear wonder work </div>

<span class="italics">Sniff</span> occurs in the passive in the expression <span class="italics">not to be sniffed at</span>, and <span class="italics">wonder</span> in the expression <span class="italics">not to be wondered at</span>. <br/><span class="italics">The rewards for those who reach the chief executive's office are <span class="bold">not to <span class="underline">be sniffed</span> at</span>.</span>

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb. The passive pattern, <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed P <span class="italics">at</span></span>, does not often occur.</p>

<div class="list"> shy away </div>

<p>When the preposition is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure II (<r>see meaning group II.8.</r>).</p>

<span class="pg">187</span> <div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by the preposition <span class="italics">from</span> and the `-ing' form of another verb. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">refrain from saying</span> something, the <span class="italics">refraining</span> and the <span class="italics">not saying</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure table above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>c) There is only one phrasal verb with this structure, <span class="italics">shy away</span>. The pattern is <span class="pattern">V P <span class="italics">from</span> -ing</span>.</p>

<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
<tr><td>1 The `switch' group </td><td>2 The `change' group </td><td>3 The `range' group </td></tr>
</table>

<div class="hd5">1 The `switch' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with stopping doing, using, or dealing with one thing and starting to do, use, or deal with another.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The plan is for the crop drier to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">change over</span> from heating oil to 80 per cent home-grown fuel by 1995</span>.</span></li>

<olist cols="3"> <c sn="0">change over</c> </olist>

<span class="pg">193</span> <div class="hd5">2 The `change' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that something becomes different.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The mood of the demonstrators <span class="bold"><span class="underline">changed</span> from outrage to jubilation</span> as they chanted `Orlando for mayor'.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">turn 17</span>, the prepositions are both followed by a noun or adjective group indicating a colour. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">from</span> colour <span class="italics">to</span> colour</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">We stretch our newly exercised limbs and watch the sky <span class="bold"><span class="underline">turn</span> from pink to golden</span>.</span></li>

<p>With all these verbs except <span class="italics">turn 17</span>, the second preposition is sometimes <span class="italics">into</span> instead of <span class="italics">to</span>. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">from</span> n <span class="italics">into</span> n</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">from</span> amount <span class="italics">to</span> amount, V P <span class="italics">from</span> amount <span class="italics">to</span> amount</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase which consists of <span class="italics">from</span> and a noun group referring to an <span class="bold">amount</span>, and another prepositional phrase which consists of <span class="italics">to</span> and a noun group referring to an amount. With the phrasal verbs, there is a particle after the verb.</p>

<span class="pg">194</span> Verbs with this pattern indicate that a quantity or level increases or decreases. The prepositional phrase with <span class="italics">from</span> indicates the original quantity or level; the prepositional phrase with <span class="italics">to</span> indicates the final quantity or level.

<olist cols="3"> <c sn="1">come down</c> <c sn="1">go down</c> <c sn="1">go up</c> <c sn="1">shoot up</c> </olist>

<p>Some of these verbs occasionally have the pattern <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">from</span> amount</span>, in clauses such as <span class="italics">Trading volumes <span class="underline">have plummeted</span> from their 1987 peaks</span> where the original amount is not specified. However, it is much more usual for both amounts to be specified.</p>

<div class="hd1">19 V <span class="italics">in</span> n</div>

<div class="st"> The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase which consists of <span class="italics">in</span> and a noun group. With some verbs, the preposition is sometimes followed by an `-ing' clause. In Structure I, the preposition is followed by an `-ing' form.

<p>This pattern has three structures:</p>

<div class="hd5">I.1 The `participate' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with helping to do something or taking part in an activity together with other people.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">We hope to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">be able to assist</span> in safeguarding</span> the future of the Leyland plant in Lancashire.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">People want to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">participate</span> in making</span> decisions.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> aid assist collaborate collude help join participate </div>

<p>When the preposition is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure III (<r>see meaning group III.5 below</r>).</p>

<div class="hd5">I.2 The `persist' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with deliberately continuing to do something.</p>


<ul class="example">

<div class="list"> persevere persist </div>

<p>When the preposition is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure III (<r> see meaning group III.9 below</r>).</p>

<div class="hd5">I.3 Verbs with other meanings</div>

<p>There are two other verbs with this structure.</p>



<ul class="example">

  <li><span class="example">Many collectors wanted to own the picture but Queen Victoria <span class="bold"><span class="underline">succeeded</span> in buying</span> it.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> indulge succeed </div>

<p>When the preposition is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure III (<r> see meaning groups III.5 and III.6 below</r>).</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by the preposition <span class="italics">in</span> and the `-ing' form of another verb. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">succeed in creating</span> something, the <span class="italics">succeeding</span> and the <span class="italics">creating</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure table above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<div class="st"> The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase which consists of <span class="italics">on</span> and a noun group. With some verbs, the preposition is sometimes followed by an `-ing' clause or a wh-clause. In Structure I, the preposition is followed by an `-ing' form.

<p>There are only two verbs with this structure. The verb <span class="italics">embark</span> indicates that someone starts doing something, and the verb <span class="italics">insist</span> indicates that someone does something even though this is not wanted or not reasonable.</p>



<ul class="example">

<p>When the preposition <span class="italics">on</span> is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure II (<r>see meaning groups II.26 and II.27 below</r>).</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by the preposition <span class="italics">on</span> and the `-ing' form of another verb. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">insist on wearing</span> something, the <span class="italics">insisting</span> and the <span class="italics">wearing</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure table above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>Verbs with this structure are all concerned with not doing something. This includes:</p>

<ul>
 <li> not doing something you had planned or promised e.g. <span class="italics">chicken</span>, <span class="italics">get</span></li> <li> stopping doing something e.g. <span class="italics">drop</span></li>
</ul>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The banks <span class="bold"><span class="underline">may drop</span> out of lending</span> to sovereign governments.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I found myself trying to scheme how I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">could get</span> out of taking</span> my kid to the beach.</span></li>

<p>When the preposition is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure II (see meaning group II.1).</p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by the preposition <span class="italics">out of</span> and the `-ing' form of another verb. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">opt out of voting</span>, the <span class="italics">opting</span> and the <span class="italics">not voting</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure table above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<div class="list"> assist help</div>



<div class="list"> help out muck in </div>

<p>When the preposition is followed by a noun group, these verbs have Structure II: <r>see meaning group II.13.</r></p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by the preposition <span class="italics">with</span> and the `-ing' form of another verb. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">proceed with making</span> something, the <span class="italics">proceeding</span> and the <span class="italics">making</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure tables above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb.</p>
