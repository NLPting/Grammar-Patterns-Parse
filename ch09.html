<div class="hd0">Chapter 9: Verb Patterns with <span class="italics">it</span></div>

<p>In this chapter we describe verb patterns in which the Subject or Object is always the word <span class="italics">it</span>. In these patterns <span class="italics">it</span> has two basic uses. It may function as a `dummy' Subject or Object pointing forward to a clause somewhere else in the sentence, in which case we call it <span class="bold">introductory <span class="italics">it</span></span>. Or it may refer vaguely to a general situation, and not point anywhere else in the sentence. In this case we call it <span class="bold">general <span class="italics">it</span></span>. This chapter contains the following sections:</p>

<ul>
 <li>1 Introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject</li>
 <li>2 Introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Object</li>
 <li>3 General <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject</li>
 <li>4 General <span class="italics">it</span> as Object</li>
</ul>

<a name="s01"/>
<div class="hd1">1 Introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject</div>

<p>In all the patterns described here, the clause begins with <span class="bold">introductory <span class="italics">it</span></span>, which is the Subject of the clause. Although it is the Subject, it does not contribute to the meaning of the clause, and is often known as a `dummy' Subject. English prefers to have old information at the beginning of a clause and new information at the end of a clause. If a clause does not contain any old information, having <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject allows all the new information to be placed at the end of a clause. For example, the clause <span class="italics">It is difficult to see what you mean</span> has two pieces of new information: <span class="italics">difficult</span> and <span class="italics">to see what you mean</span>. You could say <span class="italics">To see what you mean is difficult</span>, but then some of the new information would be at the beginning of the clause. In the clause beginning with <span class="italics">it</span>, none of the new information comes at the beginning of the clause.</p>

<p>In spoken English, the word <span class="italics">it</span> is sometimes omitted, especially with the verbs <span class="italics">look, seem</span> and <span class="italics">sound</span>, e.g. <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Looks</span> as if we're out of luck, <span class="italics">Seems</span> he knows all the answers, <span class="underline">Sounds</span> as if it runs in the family.</span> The same thing occurs with the phrase <span class="italics">it stands to reason</span>, e.g. <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Stands to reason</span> he stole it.</span> In the case of <span class="italics">be</span>, some nouns and adjectives sometimes occur without <span class="italics">it is</span>, e.g. <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Pity</span> you didn't let me know</span>.</p>

<p>All the patterns described here contain a clause such as a that-clause or a to-infinitive clause. All these are new clauses, with their own structures.</p>

<p>The patterns with introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject fall into six pattern groups:</p>

<ul class="fivet"> <li> Pattern group 1: <span class="italics">it</span> V clause</li> <li> Pattern group 2: <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n clause</li> <li> Pattern group 3: <span class="italics">it</span> V prep clause</li> <li> Pattern group 4: <span class="italics">it be</span> V-ed clause</li> <li> Pattern group 5: <span class="italics">it</span> V n clause</li> <li> Pattern group 6: <span class="italics">it</span> V adj clause</li> </ul>

<div class="hd2">Pattern group 1: <span class="italics">it</span> V clause</div>

<p>There are five patterns in this group, each consisting of <span class="italics">it</span>, the verb, and a type of clause:</p>

<ul>
 <li> 1.1 <span class="italics">it</span> V that</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">seemed</span> that I was right.</span> <li> 1.2 <span class="italics">it</span> V to-inf</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">helps</span> to talk.</span> <span class="pg">519</span> <li> 1.3 <span class="italics">it</span> V wh</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">doesn't matter</span> what you think.</span> <li> 1.4 <span class="italics">it</span> V when/if</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">hurts</span> when you forget to write.</span> <li> 1.5 <span class="italics">it</span> V as if/as though/like</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">sounds</span> as if they made a dreadful mistake.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd3">1.1 <span class="italics">it</span> V that</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a that-clause.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">it</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">that-clause</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clause</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">emerged</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that smoking reduces life-expectancy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">seemed</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that he would keep his word.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">transpired</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that the gunman had been released from jail.</td></tr></table>



<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
<tr><td>1 The `emerge' group </td><td>2 The `appear' group </td><td>3 The `hurt' group </lb></lb></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="hd5">1 The `emerge' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that something happens or becomes known, or that something is logically the case.  With some verbs the word <span class="italics">that</span> is often omitted, as in <span class="italics">It happened I was there at the time.</span></p>






<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">It</span> never really <span class="bold"><span class="underline">clicked</span> that I was homeless until I had been on the streets a couple of months.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">It <span class="underline">emerged</span> that he had a violent criminal record</span>, of which the welfare agencies had been unaware.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Doug was a good man when I knew him, but that had been a lot of years ago. And <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">figured</span> that there was a solid case against him.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Since sound is actually the motion of molecules, <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">follows</span> that the fastest speed with which the air molecules can get out of the way is the speed of sound.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">It <span class="underline">happened</span> that we had a number of very competent women</span> so it was not difficult to pick a woman to do it.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>There are five phrasal verbs with this meaning, listed below. Their pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it</span> V P that</span>.</n>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">How <span class="bold"><span class="underline">did</span> it <span class="bold">come about</span> that a man so shrewd and wise as David should fall for such a blatantly obvious confidence trick?</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">What'll happen is, <span class="bold">it<span class="underline">'ll come out</span> that he didn't shoot himself, Jack shot him.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">If <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">does turn out</span> that the inspectors have found highly enriched uranium</span>, this raises a number of questions.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> click emerge figure follow happen transpire</div>



<div class="list"> come about come out get around/round leak out turn out </div>

<p>The old-fashioned verb group <span class="italics">come to pass</span> also has this pattern.</p>

<span class="pg">520</span> <span class="example">After the war, <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">came to pass</span> that he did not resume his medical studies.</span> </span>

<div class="hd5">2 The `appear' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with what a situation is, or seems to be. They are all <span class="bold">link verbs</span> <r>(see Chapter 5)</r>. The word <span class="italics">that</span> is often omitted, as in the clause <span class="italics">It seems you understand me.</span></p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">A police spokesman said <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">appeared</span> that the bag had contained two tubes filled with pieces of lead which flew into the air injuring the eleven people.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<n>The verb <span class="italics">be</span> is not usually used alone in the affirmative in this pattern. The following types of clause are frequent: negative clauses; clauses in which <span class="italics">be</span> follows a modal; and clauses including an adverb such as <span class="italics">just</span> or <span class="italics">simply</span>.</n>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He was to be a priest, so, she thought, <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">could not be</span> that he was interested in her.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">This doesn't necessarily mean that sport can improve your emotional health; <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">could</span> simply <span class="bold">be</span> that people with a more extrovert personality are more likely to enjoy sports in the first place.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> appear be seem </div>

<div class="hd5">3 The `hurt' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate how someone feels about the event indicated by the that-clause.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Hundreds of people attended the wake and funeral. <span class="bold">It <span class="underline">helped</span> that so many people cared.</span> I felt stronger when people were around.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I have been wanting to write to you since day one. <span class="bold">It <span class="underline">hurts</span> that you cannot see this.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The bigger the cost, the more <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">matters</span> that the money should not be wasted</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> help hurt matter rankle </div>

<div class="hd3">1.2 <span class="italics">it</span> V to-inf</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a to-infinitive clause.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">it</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">to-infinitive clause</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clause</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">may help</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to talk about it.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">hurt</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to breathe.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">pays</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to shop around for the best deals.</td></tr></table>



<p>Three of the verbs with this pattern indicate that something is helpful to someone, or is a good thing.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Different building societies offer different services so <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">pays</span> to shop around.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<n>The verb <span class="italics">do</span> usually occurs in negative clauses</n>.


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I'm learning the language. A career diplomat has to. <span class="bold">It <span class="underline">doesn't do</span> to have to use translators all the time.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> (not) do help pay </div>

<p>There are two other verbs with this pattern.</p>

<span class="pg">521</span> <span class="example">Though his case was far from complete, he was convinced he was right. <span class="bold">It <span class="underline">remained</span> to convince his superiors.</span></span>

<div class="list"> hurt remain </div>

<div class="hd3">1.3 <span class="italics">it</span> V wh</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a wh-clause. There is only one verb with this pattern.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I don't think <span class="bold">it <span class="underline">matters</span> what you really are, it <span class="bold">matters</span> what you do.</span> </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> matter </div>

<div class="hd3">1.4 <span class="italics">it</span> V when/if</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a clause beginning with <span class="italics">when</span> or <span class="italics">if</span>, which indicates a situation that occurs or may occur.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">It <span class="underline">didn't help</span> when he tried to cover his mistake.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> help hurt </div>

<div class="hd3">1.5 <span class="italics">it</span> V as if, <span class="italics">it</span> V as though, <span class="italics">it</span> V like</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a clause beginning with <span class="italics">as if</span> or <span class="italics">as though</span>. In informal English, the clause sometimes begins with <span class="italics">like</span>. Some people think these clauses are incorrect, but we include them here because they occur frequently.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">it</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">as if/as though/like-clause</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clause</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">looks</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">as if there will be a rebellion.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">seemed </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">like his dream had come true.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">sounds</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">as though she is leading an invalid life.</td></tr></table>



<p>Verbs with this pattern are concerned with what a situation seems or feels like. They are all <span class="bold">link verbs</span> <r>(see Chapter 5)</r>.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">There was smoke coming up at the bottom of the hill. <span class="bold">It <span class="underline">appeared</span> as if there had been a bonfire or something.</span></span></li>

</ul>
<div class="list"> appear be feel look seem sound </div>

<div class="hd2">Pattern group 2: <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n clause</div>

<p>There are four patterns in this group, each consisting of <span class="italics">it</span>, the verb, a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span>, and a type of clause:</p>

<span class="pg">522</span> <nl> <li> 2.1 <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n that</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">seems</span> to me that I had done everything I could.</span> <li> 2.2 <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n to-inf</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">fell</span> to me to organize the event.</span> <li> 2.3 <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n wh </li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">matters</span> to me what happens to you.</span> <li> 2.4 <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n as if/as though/like</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">sounds</span> to me as if you don't want to help her.</span> </nl>

<div class="hd3">2.1 <span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">to</span> n that</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span>, and a that-clause. The prepositional phrase always indicates a human being. The prepositional phrase is the prepositional Object.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">it</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">to</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">that-clause</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">prepositional Object</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clause</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">came </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">him </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that the car following him was the same one.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">didn't occur</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">him</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that he might win.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">It</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">seemed</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">me</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">that there was absolutely no hope.</td></tr></table>



<p>The word <span class="italics">that</span> is often omitted, as in the clause <span class="italics">It seems to me you're lying.</span></p>

<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">

<div class="hd5">1 The `seem' group</div>

<p>Verbs with this pattern are concerned with what a situation seems like to someone. These verbs are also found without the prepositional phrase, in the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it</span> V that</span>. Of the verbs in this meaning group, <span class="italics">seem</span> occurs much more frequently than any of the other verbs.</p>

<p>All the verbs in this group are <span class="bold">link verbs</span> <r>(see Chapter 5)</r>.</p>


<ul class="example">

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span>, and a clause beginning with <span class="italics">as if</span> or <span class="italics">as though</span>. In informal English, the clause sometimes begins with <span class="italics">like</span>. Some people think these clauses are incorrect, but we include them because they occur frequently.</p>

<p>The prepositional phrase is the prepositional Object.</p>

<div class="hd2">Pattern group 3: <span class="italics">it</span> V prep clause</div>

<r>Patterns in which the preposition is <span class="italics">to</span> and the prepositional phrase indicates a human being have been described in Pattern group 2 above</r>.  Here we describe the patterns which contain other prepositional phrases.

<p>There are two patterns in this group, each consisting of <span class="italics">it</span>, the verb, a prepositional phrase, and a type of clause:</p>

<ul>
 <li> 3.1 <span class="italics">it</span> V prep that</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">came</span> to light that he had not been telling the truth.</span> <li> 3.2 <span class="italics">it</span> V prep to-inf</li> <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">was</span> up to me to decide what to do.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd3">3.1 <span class="italics">it</span> V prep that</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase and a that-clause. The prepositional phrase is the prepositional Complement with the verbs <span class="italics">be, come</span>, and <span class="italics">count</span>, and an Adjunct with the other verbs.</p>

Although in these patterns <span class="italics">it</span> is the Subject in a passive clause, we include them here because there is no active equivalent containing <span class="italics">it</span>.</p>

<p>This pattern is used to indicate that something is said, thought, or discovered, without indicating who said, thought, or discovered it.  The implication is that this is a group of people, people in general, or occasionally an unspecified individual: the context has to determine which of these alternatives applies.</p>

<p>This is a productive pattern and occurs occasionally with a large number of verbs concerned with saying, knowing, and thinking, such as <span class="italics">add, affirm, appreciate, compute, decree, deduce, deem, hint, hypothesize, maintain, mention, moot, perceive, postulate, speculate,</span> and <span class="italics">stipulate</span>.  The verbs listed below are the ones which are most frequently used in this way.</p>

<p>The word <span class="italics">that</span> is often omitted, as in <span class="italics">It was said he had a good head for business.</span></p>

<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<div class="hd2">Using <span class="italics">it</span> and the verb <span class="italics">be</span> to focus</div>

<p>When you want to focus on an element of the sentence, you can put <span class="italics">it</span> and a form of the verb <span class="italics">be</span> at the beginning, followed by the element you want to focus on, then a relative pronoun such as <span class="italics">who, which</span>, or <span class="italics">that</span>, then the rest of the sentence. Thus instead of saying <span class="italics">John got married last week</span>, you can focus on <span class="italics">John</span> and say <span class="italics">It was John who got married last week</span>. The meaning of this is often contrastive: <span class="italics">It was John, not Paul, who got married last week</span>.</p>

<div class="hd1">2 Introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Object</div>

<p>In all the patterns given in this section, <span class="bold">introductory <span class="italics">it</span></span> is the Object of the clause. Although it is the Object, it does not contribute to the meaning of the clause, and is often known as a `dummy' Object.</p>

<p>Many of these patterns are combinations of introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject and other patterns. For example, if the clause <span class="italics">it is difficult to understand you</span> is preceded by the verb <span class="italics">find</span>, you get a clause like <span class="italics">I find it difficult to understand you</span>. However, some patterns with introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Object cannot be explained in this way. For example, <span class="italics">I hate it when she's away</span> has no equivalent pattern with introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject.</p>

<p>The patterns with introductory <span class="italics">it</span> as Object fall into five pattern groups:</p>

<ul class="fivet"> <li> Pattern group 1: V <span class="italics">it</span> clause</li> <li> Pattern group 2: V <span class="italics">it to</span> n clause</li> <li> Pattern group 3: V <span class="italics">it as</span> n/adj clause</li> <li> Pattern group 4: V <span class="italics">it</span> n clause</li> <li> Pattern group 5: V <span class="italics">it</span> adj clause</li> </ul>

<div class="hd2">Pattern group 1: V <span class="italics">it</span> clause</div>

<p>There are two patterns in this group, each consisting of the verb, <span class="italics">it</span>, and a type of clause:</p>

<span class="pg">543</span> <nl> *1.1 V <span class="italics">it</span> that <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">loved</span> it that he cared enough to ask.</span> *1.2 V <span class="italics">it</span> when/if <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">hate</span> it when she's away.</span> </nl>

<div class="hd3">1.1 V <span class="italics">it</span> that</div>

<p>The verb is followed by <span class="italics">it</span> and a that-clause.</p>

<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
<tr><td>1 The `love' and `hate' group </td><td>2 The `arrange' group </td><td>3 Verbs with other meanings </lb></lb></td></tr>
</table>

<div class="hd5">1 The `love' and `hate' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate how a situation makes someone feel. These verbs have no equivalent passive pattern.</p>





<ul class="example">

  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">hate</span> it that you can paint contentedly while I'm feeling restless and bored.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">One of his major attractions was that he took charge. She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">loved</span> it that he made all the decisions.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can't stand</span> it that he wears a Sea World tee shirt!</span> </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> appreciate (cannot) bear hate like love resent (cannot) stand </div>

<div class="hd5">2 The `arrange' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with plans and arrangements. They are usually used in the passive. <n>The passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it be</span> V-ed that</span>, where <span class="italics">it</span> is the Subject of the clause.</n></p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">It <span class="underline">was arranged</span> that I should go along to the inn to see him.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">It <span class="underline">is planned</span> that these hostages will be released in phases over three months up to late March.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> arrange (usu passive) plan (usu passive) </div>

<div class="hd3">5.4 V <span class="italics">it</span> adj when/if</div>

<p>The verb is followed by <span class="italics">it</span>, an adjective group, and a clause beginning with <span class="italics">when</span> or <span class="italics">if</span>.</p>

<p>Most of the verbs with this pattern are concerned with how someone evaluates or judges a situation or possible situation.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">find</span> it ridiculous when people keep analysing their marriage, forever questioning whether it will turn out to be a success.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">think</span> it best if you leave at once.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<n>The passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it be</span> V-ed adj when/if</span>, where <span class="italics">it</span> is the Subject of the clause.</n>


<ul class="example">

</ul>
<span class="pg">551</span> <span class="example">We grabbed sleep when we could and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">took it in turns</span> to keep watch.</span></span>

<n>In the phrase <span class="italics">see to it that</span>, the prepositional phrase <span class="italics">to it</span> is the prepositional Object.</n>


<ul class="example">

<div class="hd1">3 General <span class="italics">it</span> as Subject</div>

<p>Sometimes the pronoun <span class="italics">it</span> does not refer to something that has been explicitly mentioned, and does not point forwards to a clause giving new information. In these cases, either it does not refer to anything at all, or it refers very vaguely to the general situation.  We call this <span class="bold">general <span class="italics">it</span></span>. In all the patterns described in this section, <span class="bold">general <span class="italics">it</span></span> is the Subject.</p>

<div class="hd3">1 <span class="italics">it</span> V</div>

<p>The verb can be used on its own, without anything following it.</p>

</ul>
<n>The to-infinitive form of these verbs is sometimes part of a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>, <span class="bold">in phase</span> with another verb such as <span class="italics">begin</span> or <span class="italics">come on</span>.</n>

This pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it</span> V <span class="italics">with rain</span></span>. Two other verbs have this pattern but do not have the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it</span> V</span>.</p>
