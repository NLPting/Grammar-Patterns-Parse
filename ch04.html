<div class="hd0">Chapter 4: Complex Patterns with Prepositions and Adverbs</div>

<p>In this chapter we describe complex verb patterns in which the verb is followed by a noun group and a prepositional phrase or an adverb group. In Sections 1 to 4 we describe patterns in which the verb is followed by a noun group and either a prepositional phrase introduced by a wide variety of prepositions or an adverb group. In Sections 5 to 27 we describe patterns in which the verb is followed by a noun group and a prepositional phrase introduced by a specific preposition, such as <span class="italics">about, to</span>, or <span class="italics">with</span>. These sections are ordered alphabetically, by preposition.</p>

<a name="s01"/>
<div class="hd1">1 V n prep/adv, V n adv/prep</div>

<div class="st">The verb is followed by a noun group and a prepositional phrase or adverb group, or by an adverb group and a noun group. The passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed prep/adv</span>.

<p>The verbs described in this section are used with both adverbs and prepositional phrases, or with a variety of prepositions.</p>

<p>Here we treat all verbs with this pattern as having one structure:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Verb with Object and Adjunct<br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">fixed</span> the shelf to the wall.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Some verbs with some prepositions have other structures, however. For example, some prepositional phrases beginning with <span class="italics">to</span> are prepositional Objects and some prepositional phrases beginning with <span class="italics">as</span> are prepositional Object Complements.</p>

<p>In English, most verbs with noun groups can be followed by Adjuncts of manner, time, or place. When information about manner, time, or place is not essential, the Adjunct is not part of the pattern. The verbs dealt with below are those which are always or typically followed by an Adjunct.</p>

<div class="hd5">26 Verbs with other meanings</div>

<p>There are a number of other verbs which have this pattern. There are two groups of these verbs.</p>

<p>(i) The adverb group or prepositional phrase indicates the degree of something or the criteria for something. The verbs <span class="italics">measure</span> and <span class="italics">secure</span> are used with a prepositional phrase, not with an adverb.</p>






<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Such a system <span class="bold"><span class="underline">would divide</span> the country on tribal lines</span>.</span></li>

<div class="list"> divide measure secure (usu passive) stretch (usu passive) work</div>



<div class="list"> let off set up </div>

<p>(ii) The adverb group or prepositional phrase indicates a physical or metaphorical place, or a time. We include here <span class="italics">make</span>, where the noun group indicates a place. Some verbs in this group, when they are used with an adverb, are used with only one or two adverbs. These adverbs are indicated in the list below.</p>









<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was brought up</span> in Shanghai</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Protein <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is found</span> in a wide variety of both animal and plant foods</span>.</span></li>

</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">present</span>, the noun group following the verb is always a reflexive pronoun. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V pron-refl prep/adv</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Perhaps I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">ought to present</span> myself at his door</span>.</span></li>

<div class="list"> bring up (usu passive) </div>

<span class="pg">325</span> <div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The noun group is the Object, and the adverb group or prepositional phrase is usually an Adjunct, although some prepositional phrases are prepositional Objects or prepositional Object Complements (<r>see page xxx</r>). <i>beginning of this section)</i></p>

<p>b) This pattern has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed prep/adv</span>. The adverb group or prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>c) The adverb group comes before or after the noun group. The prepositional phrase usually comes after the noun group. Sometimes, however, the prepositional phrase comes before the noun group, especially when the noun group is a long one. <br/><span class="italics">A few states began to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">cram</span> into their constitutions details better left to legislation</span>.</span></p>

<p>d) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. With most verbs, the Object comes either between the verb and the particle or after the particle. If the Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">posted</span> it <span class="bold">up</span></span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">posted up</span> the notice</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">He posted up it</span>. <br/>Some phrasal verbs have other restricted patterning, and these restrictions are mentioned under the meaning groups concerned.</p>

<ul>
 <li> a part of your body such as your fist or finger</li> <li> a weapon</li> <li> a torch or other instrument</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, as in the case of <span class="italics">jab</span> and <span class="italics">stab</span> for example, there may be physical contact involved.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Alan <span class="bold"><span class="underline">jabbed</span> a finger at me</span>.</span></li>

</ul>
<div class="list"> chuck fling hurl throw </div>

<div class="hd5">III.3 The `shout' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with directing remarks at someone, criticizing or insulting them, or shouting at them. This is a productive pattern: a large number of verbs which involve communication of some kind, usually angry or unpleasant, can be used with this pattern. The verbs listed here are the ones which are most frequently used in this way.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">These last remarks <span class="bold"><span class="underline">were directed</span> at a small boy who had been impatiently tapping on the counter with a coin to interrupt the shopkeeper's flow of talk.</span></span></li>

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">A great deal of research <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has been aimed</span> at developing a safe tobacco cigarette.</span> </span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">clock</span>, the noun group following the preposition is usually an <span class="bold">amount</span>. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">at</span> amount</span>.</n>

  <li><span class="example">The Irish government was forced to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">devalue</span> its pound by 10 percent</span> within the European exchange-rate mechanism.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The bank provides customers with a chart to estimate their year's bills and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">divide</span> the total by twelve.</span></span></li>

  <li><span class="example">Many resort town employers <span class="bold"><span class="underline">have raised</span> salaries by 35 to 50 percent</span> in the past year in an effort to attract needed help.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> cut devalue divide lift lower multiply raise </div>

<div class="hd5">5 Verbs with other meanings</div>

<p>There are a few other verbs which have this pattern.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He allegedly <span class="bold"><span class="underline">fathered</span> a child by a woman he had met at an equestrian event in New Zealand</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I didn't get it. I think you<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'d better run</span> it by me</span> again.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list">  father  replace run  surround  </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The noun group following the verb is the Object, and the prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">by</span> n</span>. The prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>c) Though the prepositional phrase in this structure usually comes after the noun group, it sometimes comes before it, especially when the noun group is a long one.  <br/><span class="italics">Inflation <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has multiplied</span> by about 15 the amount of money a family needs to live on.</span></span></p>

<p>d) There are only three phrasal verbs with this structure, <span class="italics">finish up, start off,</span> and <span class="italics">start out</span>. The active patterns are <span class="pattern">V n P <span class="italics">by</span> -ing</span> and <span class="pattern">V P n <span class="italics">by</span> -ing</span>. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. If the Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun.  You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">started</span> it <span class="bold">off</span> by greeting us all</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="bold">started off</span> the party by greeting us all</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">He started off it by greeting us all.</span></p>

<div class="hd2">Productive uses</div>

<p>The pattern <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">by</span> -ing</span> is productive: you can use it with a wide range of verbs involving saying or doing something. The prepositional phrase indicates the means by which something is said or done, as in <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">escaped</span> the law by fleeing the country.</span></p>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">rank</span> also has the pattern <span class="pattern">V n ord <span class="italics">in</span> n</span>. The verb is followed by a noun group, an ordinal, and a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">in</span>.

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object and Adjunct</div>

<p>a) The noun group following the verb is the Object, and the prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">in</span> n</span>. The prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>c) The prepositional phrase usually comes after the noun group. Sometimes, however, the prepositional phrase comes before the noun group, especially when the noun group is a long one. <br/><span class="italics">Philip now <span class="bold"><span class="underline">saw</span> in Arthur the means of John's downfall</span>.</span></p>

<p>d) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. If the Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">set</span> it <span class="bold">down</span> in writing</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">set down</span> the ruling in writing</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">He set down it in writing</span>.</p>

<div class="hd2">Phrasal prepositions with <span class="italics">in</span></div>

<p>There are some phrasal prepositions which consist of <span class="italics">in</span>, a noun group, and another preposition. The phrasal prepositions <span class="italics">in the form of, in the light of, in the role of,</span> and <span class="italics">in terms of</span> often follow a verb and a noun group, and so appear to be part of the pattern <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">in</span> n</span>.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Surely Magda <span class="bold"><span class="underline">hadn't</span></span> now <span class="bold"><span class="bold">cast</span> Paula in the role of desirable daughter-in-law</span>?</span></li>

  <li><span class="example">Film <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has to present</span> ideas in terms of characters</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The prepositional phrase formed with one of these phrasal prepositions is a prepositional Complement or a prepositional Object Complement. These phrasal prepositions follow verbs which indicate that something is expressed in a particular way or that someone or something is given a particular role, such as <span class="italics">cast, manifest,</span> or <span class="italics">present</span>.</p>

<div class="hd5">I.1 The `change' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with changing something into something new, or changing its form or shape. We include here verbs such as <span class="italics">amalgamate</span> and <span class="italics">weld</span>, which are concerned with putting parts together to make a whole. The prepositional phrase indicates the new thing, form, or shape.</p>





<ul class="example">

  <li><span class="example">He is well on the way to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">welding</span> some 130 staff into an efficient, courteous whole.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">form 8</span>, the noun group following the verb is always a reflexive pronoun. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V pron-refl <span class="italics">into</span> n</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Diodorus also told of the warrior women of Libya who <span class="bold"><span class="underline">formed</span> themselves into armies</span> and invaded other lands.</span></li>

<p>Many of the verbs in this group also have the pattern <span class="pattern">V n <span class="italics">from</span> n <span class="italics">into</span> n</span>. The verb is followed by a noun group and two prepositional phrases, the first beginning with <span class="italics">from</span> and the second beginning with <span class="italics">into</span>.  The passive pattern is <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">from</span> n <span class="italics">to/into</span> n</span>.</p>


<ul class="example">

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object and prepositional Object Complement</div>

<p>a) The noun group following the verb is the Object, and the prepositional phrase is the prepositional Object Complement.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">into</span> n</span>. The prepositional phrase is the prepositional Complement.</p>

If the Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Cut</span> it <span class="bold">up</span> into pieces</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Cut up</span> the lamb into pieces</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">Cut up it into pieces.</span></p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object and Adjunct</div>

<p>a) The noun group following the verb is the Object, and the prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">into</span> n</span>.  The prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>c) Though the prepositional phrase in this structure usually comes after the noun group, it sometimes comes before it, especially when the noun group is a long one.  <br/><span class="italics">We <span class="bold"><span class="underline">must incorporate</span> into the budgets this possible increase in sales.</span></span></p>

<p>d) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. If the Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">whipped</span> them <span class="underline">up</span> into a frenzy</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="bold">whipped up</span> the crowd into a frenzy</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">He whipped up them into a frenzy.</span></p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The noun group following the verb is the Object, and the prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">on</span> n</span>. The prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>c) Though the prepositional phrase in this structure usually comes after the noun group, it sometimes comes before it, especially when the noun group is a long one.

<p>c) Though the prepositional phrase in this structure usually comes after the noun group, it sometimes comes before it, especially when the noun group is a long one.  <br/><span class="italics">You authorise us to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">debit</span> to your account any applicable premium or charge.</span></span></p>

<p>d) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. If the verb comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">packed</span> them <span class="underline">off</span> to school</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">I <span class="bold"><span class="bold">packed off</span> the children to school</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">I packed off them to school.</span></p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object and Adjunct</div>

<p>a) The noun group is the Object, and the prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>. The prepositional phrase is an Adjunct.</p>

<p>c) Though the prepositional phrase usually comes after the noun group, it sometimes comes before it, especially when the noun group is a long one. <br/><span class="italics">Sceptics are right to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">treat</span> with caution the results produced using this method</span>.</span></p>
