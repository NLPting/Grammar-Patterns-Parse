<div class="hd0">Chapter 11: Auxiliaries, Modals, and Phrasal Modals</div>

<p>In this chapter we describe the patterns of two kinds of verbs which form part of the verb group: auxiliaries and modals. We also include here phrasal modals, that is, phrases which behave like modal verbs. This chapter contains:</p>

<ul>
 <li>1 Auxiliary verbs: <span class="italics">be, do, get</span>, and <span class="italics">have</span> 2 Modal verbs e.g. <span class="italics">may, must, should, will</span> 3 Phrasal modals e.g. <span class="italics">be able to, had better, would rather</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd1">1 Auxiliaries</div>

<p>There are four verbs which are sometimes auxiliary verbs: <span class="italics">be, do, get</span>, and <span class="italics">have</span>. They are used mainly to add meaning to a main verb, for example by forming a continuous tense, a passive, a negative, or an interrogative. They are also used to add meaning to a clause, for example by helping to form question tags.</p>

<p>Like other verbs, auxiliaries have tenses, some of which are formed with other auxiliaries. For example, in the clause <span class="italics">She has been singing for two hours</span>, the auxiliary <span class="italics">be</span> is used in the pattern <span class="pattern">AUX -ing</span>, that is, <span class="italics">been singing</span>. However, the auxiliary <span class="italics">be</span> itself has a tense formed by the auxiliary <span class="italics">have</span> in the pattern <span class="pattern">AUX -ed</span>, that is, <span class="italics">has been</span>.</p>

<p>DIAGRAM HERE</p>

<p>Another example is the clause <span class="italics">Our boat was being thrown around like a toy</span>, where the auxiliary <span class="italics">be</span> is used in the passive pattern <span class="pattern">AUX -ed</span>, that is, <span class="italics">being thrown</span>. However, that auxiliary itself has a tense formed by the auxiliary <span class="italics">be</span> in the pattern <span class="pattern">AUX -ing</span>, that is, <span class="italics">was being</span>. The verb group in this clause therefore contains two forms of the auxiliary verb <span class="italics">be</span>.</p>

<p>DIAGRAM HERE</p>

<p>Looking at this from another point of view, when an auxiliary is followed by an `-ing' form, an `-ed' form, or a to-infinitive form, that form may itself be that of an auxiliary verb which is followed by another verb. For example, in the clause <span class="italics">She has been arrested</span>, the auxiliary <span class="italics">have</span> is used in the pattern <span class="pattern">AUX -ed</span>, that is, <span class="italics">has been</span>. However, <span class="italics">be</span> is also an auxiliary, used here in the pattern <span class="pattern">AUX -ed</span>, that is, <span class="italics">been arrested</span>.</p>

<span class="pg">566</span> DIAGRAM HERE

<p>In this chapter, we use the terms `-ing' form, `-ed' form, and to-infinitive form to indicate either a single main verb with that form, such as <span class="italics">liking, liked</span>, or <span class="italics">to like</span>, or an auxiliary with that form together with the main verb following it, such as <span class="italics">being liked, been liked</span>, or <span class="italics">to be liked</span>.</p>

<p>Auxiliary verbs are made negative by putting <span class="italics">not</span> after them, as in <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">is</span> not swimming</span>, <span class="italics">They <span class="italics">did</span> not know</span>, or <span class="italics">He <span class="italics">has</span> not written to you.</span> In spoken English and informal written English, <span class="italics">not</span> is usually contracted to <span class="italics">n't</span> and is added to the auxiliary: <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">has</span>n't written to you.</span></p>

<p>The interrogative of verb groups formed with auxiliary verbs is made by placing the Subject after the auxiliary verb, as in <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Is</span> she swimming?</span> or <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Has</span> he not written to you?</span>. If the <span class="italics">n't</span> form of the negative is used, the Subject comes after that: <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Hasn't</span> he written to you?</span></p>

<p>Auxiliary verbs have the following patterns:</p>

<p>*AUX -ing <br/><br/><span class="italics">He <span class="underline">is</span> swimming.</span></li> <br/>*AUX to-inf<br/> <br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">is</span> to arrive at six.</span></li> <br/>*AUX neg inf<br/> <br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Do</span>n't go!</span></li> <br/>*AUX n inf <br/> <br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Did</span> they remember?</span></li> <br/>*AUX inf<br/> <br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Do</span> come in.</span></li> <br/>*AUX -ed<br/> <br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">got</span> knocked down.</span></li> <br/>*AUX<br/> <br/><span class="italics">She's probably earning more than I <span class="underline">am</span>.</span></li> <br/>*cl AUX n<br/> <br/><span class="italics">She hasn't finished, <span class="underline">has</span> she?</span></li> <br/>*<span class="italics">so/nor/neither</span> AUX n<br/> <br/><span class="italics">...so <span class="underline">do</span> I.</span></li> <br/>*AUX n -ed<br/> <br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Had</span> I known...</span></li></p>

<div class="hd3">AUX -ing</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb <span class="italics">be</span> is followed by the `-ing' form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">-ing form</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">am</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">being punished.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">He</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">was</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">driving</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">too quickly.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">She</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">is</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">writing</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">a novel.</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern is used to form continuous tenses.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Darkness <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was</span> coming</span>, a pink glow above the rooftops.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was</span> being questioned</span> at a police station in London.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Everybody <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span> complaining</span> about the recession.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">An air and sea rescue operation <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has been</span> going on</span> all day for the crew of a fishing trawler which sank in the English Channel.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX to-inf</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb <span class="italics">be</span> is followed by the to-infinitive form of another verb. The two verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span> and form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>.</p>

<span class="pg">567</span> <table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">to-infinitive</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">The talks</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">are</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to begin</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">tomorrow.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">She</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">is</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to be congratulated.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">He</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">was</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">to become</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">President.</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern is used to talk about something that will happen, something that should happen, something that would happen under certain conditions, or something that has happened, seen from the viewpoint of a time before it happened, and when it was not expected.</p>







<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The Prime Minister <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span> to get</span> a full briefing on the release of the hostages next week.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">She said if she didn't get back by six, I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was</span> to call</span> the police. </span></li>
  <li><span class="example">What <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span> to be done</span>?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">If you <span class="bold"><span class="underline">were</span> to rub</span> a piece of plastic with a cloth, you would produce static electricity.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He needs to pull his socks up if he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span> to make</span> a success of his England career.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Other reformers such as Thomas Spence, who <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was</span> to become</span> a more significant radical influence at a later date, substituted phonetic for conventional spellings in their writings. </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX neg inf</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb <span class="italics">do</span> is followed by the negative <span class="italics">not</span> and the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">negative</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">infinitive</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb...</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Negative</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">...Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">He</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">did</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">not</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">like</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">cakes.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Do</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">not</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">open</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">the box.</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern with <span class="italics">do</span> is used to make negative forms of verbs in the simple present and the simple past tenses, and to make negative imperatives.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Franklin <span class="bold"><span class="underline">did</span> not want</span> Wilson to resign.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">does</span> not have</span> a name until much later in the story.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Do</span>n't</span> ever <span class="bold">call</span> this number again.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX n inf</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb <span class="italics">do</span> is followed by a noun group and the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group. The noun group is the Subject.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">infinitive</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb...</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">...Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Do</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">you</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">like</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">chocolate?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Did</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">she</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">break</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">her leg?</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern with <span class="italics">do</span> is used to make questions with verbs in the simple present and the simple past tenses.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">What <span class="bold"><span class="underline">do</span> you mean</span>?</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">568</span> <span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Does</span> she love</span> you?</span>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Where <span class="bold"><span class="underline">did</span> they find</span> the money?</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX inf</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb <span class="italics">do</span> is followed by the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">infinitive</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">do</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">understand.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Do</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">have</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">another biscuit.</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern is used to add emphasis to a verb in the simple present or the simple past tense, for example because it contrasts with something that has previously been said or implied. It is also used to invite someone politely to do something.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He doesn't say too much, but what he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">does</span> say</span> either enhances the absurd humour or the spectacle.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Well, as a matter of fact, I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">did</span> want</span> to talk to you about something. </span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Do</span> sit down</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX -ed</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb is followed by the `-ed' form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">-ed form</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">They</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">were</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">eaten</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">by rats.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">We</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">got</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">married</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">in September.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">He</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">has</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">finished</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">his work.</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern has four uses.</p>

<p>1 The auxiliaries <span class="italics">be</span> and <span class="italics">get</span> are used with this pattern to form the passive. <span class="italics">Be</span> is used much more frequently in this way than <span class="italics">get</span>.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Doctors believe more research <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span> needed</span> into the spread of the disease.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">No suspects <span class="bold"><span class="underline">have been</span> picked up</span> yet by police.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`Did I get you into trouble?' she asked. He laughed. `No. I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">got</span> teased</span> a bit,' he added.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>2 The auxiliary <span class="italics">have</span> is used with this pattern to form perfect tenses.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Mount Pinatubo <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has</span> blanketed</span> the countryside with volcanic ash, up to half a meter deep.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Jupe picked one of the magazines up and leafed through it. Someone <span class="bold"><span class="underline">had</span> inserted</span> a slip of paper halfway through to mark a place.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Having</span> established</span> his business in San Francisco in the 1960s, he travelled to England with the simple objective of catching up with contemporary British design.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The verb <span class="italics">have</span> is also used with the `-ed' form of the auxiliary <span class="italics">be</span> to form perfect continuous tenses. This pattern is <span class="pattern">AUX <span class="italics">been</span> -ing</span>.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">So far Indonesia <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has</span> been accepting</span> all boat people arriving on its shores - some twelve hundred each month.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">569</span> 3 The auxiliary <span class="italics">get</span> is used with this pattern, but without making a passive, to indicate that an action, usually something difficult, is successfully achieved. This is an informal use.



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He spoke in a hasty, nervous way, as if once he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">had got</span> started</span> he was afraid that he might be interrupted.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Until I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">get</span> warmed up</span> it's difficult to run and there's pain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>4 The to-infinitive form of the auxiliary verb <span class="italics">be</span> is used with this pattern, usually with the verbs <span class="italics">found, heard</span>, or <span class="italics">seen</span> to indicate that people can find, hear, or see something somewhere.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Most of his works are <span class="bold"><span class="underline">to be</span> found</span> in the area around Arezzo. </span></li>
  <li><span class="example">There's hardly a tree <span class="bold"><span class="underline">to be</span> seen</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb is used with nothing following it, or with just <span class="italics">not</span> following it, when confirming or contradicting a statement, in short answers to questions, or following comparatives. This pattern is used with the auxiliaries <span class="italics">be, do</span> and <span class="italics">have</span>.</p>







<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">`I'm keeping my piranhas,' Paul said. `No you<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'re not</span></span>,' said his mother. `Yes I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">am</span></span>,' said Paul.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`Is Debbie coming to see us tomorrow?' `Yes, she <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is</span></span>.'</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`Governor Clinton never indicated during the campaign that he supported a gasoline tax.' `No, he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">didn't</span></span>.'</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">You'd imagine that I'd learn with age but I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">don't</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`You've never even seen it!' `Yes I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">have</span></span>,' snapped Betty.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">My grandparents were very poor and they wanted their kids to do better than they <span class="bold"><span class="underline">had</span></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">cl AUX n</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb follows a clause and is followed by a noun group. The noun group is the Subject of the auxiliary verb. It is usually a personal pronoun.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">clause</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clause</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">She isn't laughing,</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">is</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">she?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">You live in Birmingham,</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">don't</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">you?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">They hadn't been arrested,</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">had </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">they?</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern is used with <span class="italics">be, do</span>, and <span class="italics">have</span> to form question tags, which ask the hearer or reader to confirm a statement. A negative statement is always followed by a positive question tag. A positive statement may be followed by a negative or a positive question tag. A negative question tag following a positive statement indicates that the information is considered to be shared. A positive question tag following a positive statement indicates that the information is not considered to be shared, but is something that the hearer alone has the right to confirm or deny.</p>

<p>In the case of <span class="italics">be</span> and <span class="italics">have</span>, the clause before the question tag contains a verb group formed with <span class="italics">be</span> or <span class="italics">have</span> as an auxiliary. In the case of <span class="italics">do</span>, the clause contains a verb group formed with <span class="italics">do</span> as an auxiliary, or a verb without an auxiliary.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">He isn't wearing shorts, <span class="underline">is</span> he</span>?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Ah, <span class="bold">you're making an assumption there, <span class="underline">are</span> you</span>?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">You liked Gil, <span class="underline">didn't</span> you</span>?</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">They'd moved up here before you were born, <span class="underline">had</span> they</span>?</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">570</span> <div class="hd3"><span class="italics">so/nor/neither</span> AUX n</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb follows one of the conjunctions <span class="italics">so, nor</span>, or <span class="italics">neither</span> and is followed by a noun group. The noun group is the Subject of the auxiliary verb.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">so/nor/neither</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Conjunction</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">So</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">am</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Nor</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">did</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">John.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Neither</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">had</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">they.</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern is used with <span class="italics">be, do</span>, and <span class="italics">have</span> to indicate a situation that is similar to one mentioned in a previous clause, but with a different person involved.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">`I'm working at home on Wednesday.' `<span class="bold">So <span class="underline">am</span> I</span>.'</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He never spoke of my mother; <span class="bold">nor <span class="underline">did</span> my aunt or my grandmother</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`I've never been to Alcatraz.' `<span class="bold">Neither <span class="underline">have</span> I</span>.'</span></li>
</ul>
<n>This pattern, with <span class="italics">nor</span>, is also used to confirm a previous clause. This is a formal use. In spoken English, the stress is on the auxiliary rather than the Subject.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He confirmed there and then: `I will never race again.' <span class="bold">Nor <span class="underline">did</span> he</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">AUX n -ed</div>

<p>The auxiliary verb <span class="italics">had</span> is followed by a noun group and the `-ed' form of another verb. The noun group is the Subject. This pattern is always used with another clause, which comes before or after this one.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Auxiliary</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">noun group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">-ed</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb...</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">...Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Had</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">known...</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Had</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">she</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">remembered</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">her lines...</td></tr></table>



<p>This pattern is used to indicate a situation that might have happened but did not. Its meaning is similar to the meaning of a clause beginning with <span class="italics">if</span>, but this pattern is more formal.</p>

<div class="hd1">2 Modals</div>

<p>There are eleven modal verbs in English. They are used to add meaning to a main verb, for example to indicate how certain or possible something is, or how frequently something happens, or whether a course of action is recommended or allowed.</p>

<span class="pg">571</span>
<span class="list" cols="3"> <c>can</c> <c>could</c> <c>dare</c> <c>may</c> <c>might</c> <c>must</c> <c>need</c> <c>shall</c> <c>should</c> <c>will</c> <c>would</c> </span>

<p>Unlike ordinary verbs and auxiliary verbs, modal verbs do not change their form depending on the Subject. For example, you say <span class="italics">I must</span> and <span class="italics">He must</span>.</p>

<p>Unlike ordinary verbs and auxiliary verbs, modal verbs do not change their form to indicate tense, although <span class="italics">could, should</span>, and <span class="italics">would</span> are sometimes considered to be the past equivalents of <span class="italics">can, shall</span>, and <span class="italics">will</span>. It is better, however, to think of these words as different verbs, not as different forms of the same verb, because they have very different meanings. The pattern <span class="pattern">MODAL <span class="italics">have</span> -ed</span> is sometimes used to talk about something in the past, as in <span class="italics">She must have seen him</span>.</p>

<p>Modal verbs are made negative by putting <span class="italics">not</span> after them, as in <span class="italics">She might not be happy</span>, or <span class="italics">You should not go</span>. In spoken and informal written English, <span class="italics">not</span> is usually contracted to <span class="italics">n't</span> and is added to the modal: <span class="italics">You shouldn't go</span>. The negative form of <span class="italics">can</span> is <span class="italics">cannot</span>. In spoken and informal written English this is usually contracted to <span class="italics">can't</span>. Similarly, <span class="italics">shall not</span> is usually contracted to <span class="italics">shan't</span> and <span class="italics">will not</span> to <span class="italics">won't</span>.</p>

<p>The interrogative of verb groups formed with modal verbs is made by placing the Subject after the modal verb, as in <span class="italics">Might she be happy?</span> or <span class="italics">Should you not go?</span> If the <span class="italics">n't</span> form of the negative is used, the Subject comes after that: <span class="italics">Shouldn't you go?</span></p>

<p>The modal verbs <span class="italics">dare</span> and <span class="italics">need</span> also occur as main verbs. In <span class="italics">He doesn't dare climb the tree</span>, <span class="italics">dare</span> is a main verb, but in <span class="italics">He dare not climb the tree</span>, <span class="italics">dare</span> is a modal verb.</p>

<p>There are two main patterns associated with modal verbs:</p>

<p>*MODAL inf<br/><br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">must</span> be mad.</span></li> <br/>*MODAL <span class="italics">have</span> -ed<br/> <br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">must</span> have missed the bus.</span></li></p>

<div class="hd3">MODAL inf</div>

<p>The modal verb is followed by the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> form of another verb. The two verbs together form the verb group. The bare infinitive may be <span class="italics">be</span> followed by an `-ed' form or an `-ing' form.</p>

<p>All the modal verbs are used with this pattern, with a variety of meanings. These include:</p>

<ul>
 <li> expressing certainty or uncertainty about a situation e.g. <span class="italics">could, might, must</span></li> <li> saying what sometimes happens e.g. <span class="italics">can, may</span></li> <li> talking about an obligation e.g. <span class="italics">must, need, should</span></li> <li> talking about ability e.g. <span class="italics">can, could</span></li> <li> saying what someone dare do</li> <span class="pg">572</span> <li> talking about future possibilities e.g. <span class="italics">may, shall, will</span></li> <li> talking about permission e.g. <span class="italics">can, may, might</span></li> <li> talking about something hypothetical e.g. <span class="italics">should, would</span></li>

</ul>
<div class="hd3">MODAL <span class="italics">have</span> -ed</div>

<p>The modal verb is followed by <span class="italics">have</span> and the `-ed' form of another verb. The three verbs together form the verb group. The `-ed' form may be of the auxiliary verb <span class="italics">be</span>, with another verb following it. In this chapter we treat the auxiliary <span class="italics">be</span> and the following verb together as the `-ed' form. (<r>See Section 1 above.</r>)</p>

<div class="hd2">Other related patterns</div>

<p>In addition to the two patterns described above, modal verbs are used in two patterns that are the same as those used with auxiliary verbs.</p>

<span class="pg">573</span> <div class="hd3">MODAL</div>

<p>The modal verb is used with nothing following it, or with just <span class="italics">not</span> following it, when confirming or contradicting a statement, in short answers to questions, or following comparatives. (<r>See <span class="pattern">AUX inf</span> in Section 1 above.</r>) All the modal verbs except <span class="italics">dare</span> and <span class="italics">need</span> are used in this pattern.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">His mother could no more relax than he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">could</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`You'll never see it,' he said. `Yes, he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">will</span></span>,' said a voice.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">cl MODAL n</div>

<p>The modal verb follows a clause and is followed by a noun group which is the Subject. This forms a tag question. (<r> See <span class="pattern">cl AUX n</span> in Section 1 above.</r>) All the modal verbs are used in this pattern.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">You'll look after me, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">won't</span> you</span>, Mama?</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd1">3 Phrasal modals</div>

<p>Phrasal modals are phrases which form a single verb group with another verb and which affect the meaning of that verb in the same way that a modal verb does. In the Collins Cobuild English Dictionary they have the label <span class="pattern">PHR-MODAL</span>.</p>

<p>Some phrasal modals begin with <span class="italics">be</span> or <span class="italics">have</span>: <span class="italics">be able to, be bound to, be going to, be liable to, be meant to, be supposed to, be sure to, be unable to, have got to</span>, and <span class="italics">have to</span>. The first word in these phrases changes its form depending on the Subject and the tense, in the way that <span class="italics">be</span> and <span class="italics">have</span> normally do. You say <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">am</span> liable to panic</span> and <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">is</span> liable to panic</span>, <span class="italics">We <span class="italics">have</span> to leave tonight</span> and <span class="italics">They <span class="underline">had</span> to leave last night</span>. The other phrasal modals do not change in this way. You say <span class="italics">I would rather go by bus</span> and <span class="italics">He would rather go by bus</span>.</p>

<p>Most phrasal modals are made negative by putting <span class="italics">not</span> after the first word in the phrase, as in <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">is</span> not <span class="italics">able to</span> be with us</span> or <span class="italics">You <span class="underline">ought</span> not <span class="italics">to</span> eat so quickly</span>. However, <span class="italics">had best, had better, would rather, would just as soon</span>, and <span class="italics">would sooner</span> are made negative by putting <span class="italics">not</span> after the whole phrase, as in <span class="italics">You <span class="underline">had best</span> not go by yourself</span> or <span class="italics">I <span class="italics">would just as soon</span> not go by myself</span>. The negative of <span class="italics">would do well to</span> is made by putting <span class="italics">not</span> after <span class="italics">well</span>, as in <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">would do well</span> not <span class="italics">to</span> forget that</span>. The phrasal modal <span class="italics">used to</span> has three negative forms: <span class="italics">used not to, didn't used to</span>, and <span class="italics">didn't use to</span>.</p>

<p>The interrogative of verb groups formed with most phrasal modals is made by placing the Subject after the first word in the phrase, as in <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Have</span> you <span class="italics">got to</span> go?</span> or <span class="italics"><span class="italics">Would</span> you <span class="underline">sooner</span> stay?</span> The interrogative form of <span class="italics">have to</span> is <span class="italics">do you have to</span>, as in <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Do</span> you <span class="italics">have to</span> go?</span> The interrogative form of <span class="italics">used to</span> is <span class="italics">did you used to</span>, as in <span class="italics"><span class="underline">Did</span> you <span class="italics">used to</span> eat sweets?</span>.</p>

<p>Phrasal modals have the following patterns:</p>

<p>*MODAL inf<br/><br/><span class="italics">I <span class="underline">have to</span> go.</span></li> <br/>*MODAL<br/> <br/><span class="italics">Go if you <span class="underline">have to</span>.</span></li> <br/>*MODAL inf <span class="italics">than/as</span> inf<br/> <br/><span class="italics">I<span class="underline">'d rather</span> die than surrender.</span></li> <br/>*MODAL that<br/> <br/><span class="italics">I<span class="underline">'d rather</span> you didn't.</span></li></p>

<span class="pg">574</span> <div class="hd3">MODAL inf</div>

<p>The phrasal modal is followed by the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> of another verb. The phrasal modal and the infinitive together form the verb group.</p>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Phrasal modal</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">infinitive</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Completive</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">She</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">is able to</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">sit up</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">in a wheelchair.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">They</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">were going to</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">shoot</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">something.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">He</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">used to</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">shout</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">at people.</td></tr></table>

<div class="hd3">MODAL</div>

<p>The phrasal modal is used with nothing following it, when the verb it refers to is clear from the immediately preceding context.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">`It's not really improving anything.' `No, but perhaps it<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'s not meant to</span></span>.'</span></li>

  <li><span class="example">I wish I could run about like I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">used to</span></span>, and I love dancing. Well, I can't do that any more.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">would rather</span> and <span class="italics">would sooner</span>, the phrasal modal is usually followed by <span class="italics">not</span>, and the pattern is <span class="pattern">MODAL <span class="italics">not</span></span>.</n>



<ul class="example">

<div class="hd3">MODAL inf <span class="italics">than/as</span> inf</div>

<p>The phrasal modal is followed by the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> of another verb, <span class="italics">than</span>, and the <span class="bold">bare infinitive</span> of another verb. In the case of <span class="italics">would just as soon</span>, <span class="italics">as</span> is used instead of <span class="italics">than</span>.

<div class="hd3">MODAL that</div>

<p>The phrasal modal is followed by a that-clause. The phrasal modal by itself is the verb group and the that-clause is a new clause, with its own structure.</p>
