<div class="hd0">Chapter 7: Ergative Verbs</div>

<div class="hd1">Introduction</div>

<div class="hd4">What an ergative verb is</div>

<p>An ergative verb has the following features:</p>

<ul>
 <li> it has two patterns</li> <li> only one of these patterns has a noun group following the verb</li> <li> the person or thing indicated by that noun group may also be indicated by the Subject of the other pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the verb <span class="italics">break</span> has two patterns, <span class="pattern">V</span> and <span class="pattern">V n</span>. Only one of these patterns, <span class="pattern">V n</span>, has a noun group following the verb. An example of the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span> is <span class="italics">John broke the vase</span>. The noun group following the verb, <span class="italics">the vase</span>, may also be the Subject of the verb: <span class="italics">The vase broke</span>.</p>

<div class="hd4">Combinations of patterns with ergative verbs</div>

<p>Some ergative verbs have symmetrical combinations of patterns. For example, the verb <span class="italics">break</span> has a combination of two patterns, <span class="pattern">V</span> and <span class="pattern">V n</span>. This combination is symmetrical because the only difference between the two patterns is that one has a noun group following the verb and the other does not. You say <br/><span class="italics">The stick <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span> <br/>and <span class="italics">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span> the stick</span>.</slx></p>

<p>Some ergative verbs have combinations of patterns that are asymmetrical, that is, the patterns are different in more ways than the presence or absence of a noun group. For example, the verb <span class="italics">puff</span> has the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span> but not the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span>. Instead, it has the pattern <span class="pattern">V prep/adv</span>. Therefore, you say <br/><span class="italics">The chimney <span class="bold"><span class="underline">puffed</span> smoke</span></span> <br/>and <span class="italics">Smoke <span class="bold"><span class="underline">puffed</span> out of the chimney</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">Smoke puffed</span>.</p>

<div class="hd4">What the patterns indicate</div>

<p>When you use an ergative verb, you have a choice between two (or more) patterns.  These patterns allow you to talk about the world in very different ways. For example, you can choose to indicate that something just happens, perhaps as a natural occurrence, without indicating that someone or something is responsible for it. Or you can indicate that someone or something is the cause of what happens and so is responsible for it. Compare the examples below. (Unlike the other examples in this book, these and the following examples in this Introduction have been invented to illustrate the differences in meaning between the patterns.)</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The vase <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">John <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span> the vase</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example"> <span class="bold"><span class="underline">varies</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">The technician <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can vary</span> the volume</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">Many factories <span class="bold"><span class="underline">closed</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">The government's policies <span class="bold"><span class="underline">closed</span> many factories</span>.</span> </div>

<p>In the first example in each pair there is only one noun group. This noun group indicates something that does something or has something happen to it: the vase breaks, the  <span class="pg">475</span> volume varies, and the factories close. We can call the vase, the volume, and the factories the `doer'. In these examples with only a `doer', you are not told what the cause of the action is. In fact, you may understand that the action has no cause. You may think, for example, that the vase broke by itself. Or you may understand that there is a cause but that the speaker or writer has chosen not to mention it. You may think, for example, that someone caused the vase to break but that the speaker or writer is deliberately hiding that information.</p>

<p>In the second example in each pair there are two noun groups. One of them is the `doer' and the other indicates the person or thing that causes the action: John causes the vase to break, the technician causes the volume to vary, and the government's policies cause the factories to close. We can call John, the technician, and the government's policies the `causer'. In these examples with both a `doer' and a `causer', you can understand the clause in only one way: that someone or something caused something to happen.</p>

<p>How the `doer' and the `causer' relate to the action depends on who or what they are. Here are some more examples:</p>

<div class="hd8">(i) `Doer' and `causer' are both animate</div>

<p>Where the `doer' and the `causer' are both animate and the action is something that is under the control of the `doer', the exact roles of the `doer' and the `causer' vary according to the verb.</p>

<p>The `causer' may be someone in authority who encourages or orders the `doer' to do the action.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The horse <span class="bold"><span class="underline">galloped</span> down the hill</span>.</span> <span class="example">The rider <span class="bold"><span class="underline">galloped</span> his horse down the hill</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The squad <span class="bold"><span class="underline">marched</span> down the hill</span>.</span> <span class="example">The sergeant <span class="bold"><span class="underline">marched</span> the squad down the hill</span>.</span> </div>

<p>The `causer' may provide conditions that allow the `doer' to do the action.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The cows <span class="bold"><span class="underline">grazed</span></span> in the water meadows.</span> <span class="example">The farmer <span class="bold"><span class="underline">grazed</span> the cows</span> in the water meadows.</span> </div>

<p>The `doer' and the `causer' may both be involved in the action, with different responsibilities.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">auditioned</span></span> on Tuesday.</span> <span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">auditioned</span> her</span> on Tuesday.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">enrolled</span> on a two-year course</span>.</span> <span class="example">The tutor <span class="bold"><span class="underline">enrolled</span> him on a two-year course</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="hd8">(ii) `Doer' is inanimate, `causer' is animate</div>

<p>Where the `doer' is inanimate, or is animate but the action is not under their control, and the `causer' is animate, the exact roles of the `doer' and `causer' vary according to the verb.</p>

<p>The `causer' may hold ultimate responsibility for the action, even though he or she does not intend to cause the action.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The vase <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span> when it fell on the floor.</span> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span> the vase</span> when he dropped it on the floor.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The car <span class="bold"><span class="underline">crashed</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">crashed</span> his car</span>.</span> </div>

<p>The `causer' may provide the conditions in which a natural process takes place.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">Raspberries <span class="bold"><span class="underline">freeze</span> well</span>.</span> <span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">froze</span> some raspberries</span>.</span> </div>

<p>The `causer' may not cause the action at all, but may be affected by the action, for example by suffering an injury.</p>

<span class="pg">476</span> <div class="gx"> <span class="example">His leg <span class="bold"><span class="underline">fractured</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">fractured</span> his leg</span>.</span> </div>

<p>The `doer' may not do anything, but may be affected by the action.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The bucket <span class="bold"><span class="underline">filled</span></span> in two minutes.</span> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">filled</span> the bucket</span> in two minutes.</span> </div>

<div class="hd8">(iii) `Doer' may be animate or inanimate depending on the verb, `causer' is inanimate</div>

<p>When the `causer' is inanimate, it may be the immediate cause of the action.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The vase <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">The impact <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span> the vase</span>.</span> </div>

<p>Alternatively, the `causer' may be an indirect cause of the action.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">Her spirits <span class="bold"><span class="underline">lifted</span></span> as if by magic.</span> <span class="example">The party <span class="bold"><span class="underline">lifted</span> her spirits</span> as if by magic.</span> </div>

<div class="hd4">Patterns with reflexive pronouns</div>

<p>With many ergative verbs, the noun group following the verb is sometimes a reflexive pronoun. When this is the case, the `doer' and the `causer' are the same person or thing. Sometimes this means that there is little difference in meaning between this pattern and the pattern which mentions only the `doer'. For example, the first two examples below mean almost the same thing, although they have different patterns, but the third example has a different meaning.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The symptoms of the illness <span class="bold"><span class="underline">manifested</span></span> ten days later. </span> <span class="example">The symptoms of the illness <span class="bold"><span class="underline">manifested</span> themselves</span> ten days later. </span> <span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">manifested</span> all the symptoms of the illness</span>.</span> </div>

<p>Sometimes, however, the pattern with a reflexive pronoun emphasizes that the Subject of that pattern is the cause of an event and also the person or thing that is affected by it. This is true particularly when the verb involved indicates that a person suffers harm. For example, the first example below suggests that the drowning was an accident, the second example suggests that it was suicide, and the third example suggests that it was murder.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">drowned</span></span> in the river.</span> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">drowned</span> himself</span> in the river.</span> <span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">drowned</span> him</span> in the river.</span> </div>

<p>The following ergative verbs often have a reflexive pronoun following the verb.</p>

<div class="list"> acclimatize assimilate attach beach disengage drown hang manifest overstretch plunge resolve </div>

<div class="hd4">Ergative verbs and the passive</div>

<p>In patterns where there is a noun group (the Object) following the verb, the `causer' is indicated by the Subject and the `doer' is indicated by the Object. If that structure is made passive, however, the `doer' becomes the Subject and the `causer' may not be mentioned. Compare the following examples:</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The vase <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">John <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span> the vase</span>.</span> <span class="example">The vase <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was broken</span></span>.</span> </div>

<p>The third example is the passive of the second example. We said above that in the first example, you may understand that the vase broke by itself or that someone caused the vase to break, whilst in the second example, you must understand that John caused the vase to break. In the third example, you understand that the vase did not break by itself, but do not know who caused the breakage. The Subjects of the first and the third examples are the same, but the meanings are different.</p>

<span class="pg">477</span> <div class="hd4">Actual and potential events</div>

<p>Most ergative verbs can be used to indicate events that have taken place (actual events), or events that might take place (potential events). An example of an actual event is:</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The glass <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of potential events are:</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">This kind of glass tends to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">break</span></span> in cold weather.</span> <span class="example">This kind of glass <span class="bold"><span class="underline">breaks</span></span> easily.</span> </div>

<p>Some ergative verbs, in the pattern with the `doer' as Subject, are usually used only to indicate potential events. The pattern with the `causer' as Subject can be used to indicate both actual and potential events.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">This cream smells clean and fresh, and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">applies</span> easily</span>.</span> <span class="example">After you have stepped from a warm bath, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">apply</span> the cream</span> evenly over your body.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">These eye shadows <span class="bold"><span class="underline">won't fade</span></span> or crease and contain herbal extracts to soften the skin.</span> <span class="example">Ultraviolet light <span class="bold"><span class="underline">will fade</span> the colours in organic materials</span>.</span> </div>

<p>These verbs are indicated in the meaning groups described below.</p>

<div class="hd4">Ergative link verbs</div>

<p>There are a few verbs which are ergative and which in one of their patterns only are <span class="bold">link verbs</span> (<r>see also Chapter 5</r>). For example, the verb <span class="italics">turn</span>, in the pattern <span class="pattern">V colour</span>, is a link verb. It also has the pattern <span class="pattern">V n colour</span>, in which it is not a link verb.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">The feet start to burn, feel hot to the touch, and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">turn</span> bright red</span>.</span> <span class="example">She experienced a tremendous flush, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">turning</span> her bright red</span>.</span> </div>

<p>The following verbs are <span class="bold">ergative link verbs</span>.</p>

<div class="list"> form keep rank rate turn </div>

<div class="hd4">About this chapter</div>

<p>In this chapter you will find information about all the combinations of patterns that occur with ergative verbs. As in the other chapters, information about clause structure is given here. This information is less detailed than in the other chapters, however. For example, we do not here show the patterns or structures of passives, or of phrasal verbs, although we do include examples of passives and phrasal verbs.</p>

<p>If you want to find out more about the patterns and structures described in this chapter, look in the relevant sections in Chapters 1-4.</p>

<div class="hd1">Pattern Combinations</div>

<p>There are six symmetrical combinations of patterns.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Pattern combination 1: V; V n<br/><span class="italics">The vase <span class="underline">broke</span>.</span> <span class="italics">John <span class="underline">broke</span> the vase.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 2: V prep/adv; V n prep/adv<br/><span class="italics">The boat <span class="underline">sailed</span> up the river.</span> <span class="italics">We <span class="underline">sailed</span> the boat up the river.</span></li> <span class="pg">478</span> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 3: V adj; V n adj<br/><span class="italics">The door <span class="underline">slammed</span> shut.</span> <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">slammed</span> the door shut.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 4: V <span class="italics">as</span> adj; V n <span class="italics">as</span> adj<br/><span class="italics">That score <span class="underline">counts</span> as successful.</span> <span class="italics">We <span class="underline">count</span> that score as successful.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 5: V to-inf; V n to-inf<br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">trained</span> to compete.</span> <span class="italics">They <span class="underline">trained</span> her to compete.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 6: V ord prep; V n ord prep<br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">rank</span> sixth in the world.</span> <span class="italics">Most people <span class="underline">rank</span> them sixth in the world.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>There are four asymmetrical combinations.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Pattern combination 7: V prep/adv; V n; V n prep/adv<br/><span class="italics">Light <span class="underline">reflects</span> on the water.</span> <span class="italics">The mirror <span class="underline">reflects</span> light.</span>  <span class="italics">The glass <span class="underline">reflected</span> light onto the wall.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 8: V prep/adv; V n<br/><span class="italics">Smoke <span class="underline">puffed</span> out of the chimney.</span> <span class="italics">The chimney <span class="underline">puffed</span> smoke.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 9: V adv; V n<br/><span class="italics">This carpet <span class="underline">cleans</span> easily.</span> <span class="italics">We <span class="underline">cleaned</span> the carpet.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 10: V adj; V n<br/><span class="italics">The chair <span class="underline">folds</span> flat.</span> <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">folded</span> the chair.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd2">Pattern combination 1: V; V n</div>

<p>In the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span>, the verb can be used on its own, without anything following it. In the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span>, the verb is followed by a noun group. This pattern combination is symmetrical.</p>

<p>This combination of patterns has one combination of structures:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Verb; Verb with Object<br/><span class="italics">The window <span class="underline">broke</span>.</span> <span class="italics">They <span class="underline">broke</span> the window.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd5">1.1 The `change' group</div>

<p>In the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span>, these verbs are concerned with something changing. In the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span>, they are concerned with someone or something bringing about a change. The verbs in this group have general meanings. More specific kinds of change are dealt with in other meaning groups below.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">As society <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has changed</span></span> in Java, the ways in which dancers are taught <span class="bold"><span class="underline">have</span></span> also <span class="bold"><span class="bold">changed</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">Those who wish to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">change</span> society</span> have to create an active, political community.</span> </div>

<div class="list"> alter change metamorphose vary </div>

<span class="pg">480</span> <div class="hd5">1.2 The `break' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with something breaking or being damaged. They may be divided into two groups:</p>

<p>(i) In the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span>, these verbs indicate that something breaks or shows damage of some kind. In the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span>, they indicate that someone or something breaks or damages something or someone. The Subject in the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span> is the person or thing that causes the damage.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">He slammed the door with such force that a window <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">They threw stones and <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span> the windows of buses</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">While children can swallow many small objects without ill effect, batteries can cause severe damage if they <span class="bold"><span class="underline">corrode</span></span> inside the body.</span> <span class="example">It is claimed that chewing gum helps prevent tooth decay by stimulating saliva, which neutralises the acids that <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can corrode</span> teeth</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">In due time, Carey would go free while his accomplices <span class="bold"><span class="underline">hanged</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">The convicted men were due to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">be hanged</span></span> this week, having lost their appeal recently.</span> </div>

<n>With some of these verbs, the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span> is usually used to indicate that something often happens (a potential event), rather than to indicate an actual event.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Men tend to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">bruise</span></span> far more than women, because of the way their fat is arranged on the body.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>These verbs are often followed by an adverb such as <span class="italics">easily</span>. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V adv</span> (<r>see also page xxx</r>).</n> <i>Ch2 Sec2</i>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I keep a jar of comfrey ointment which clears up bruises fast. I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">bruise</span> very easily</span> and the ointment is brilliant.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> break bruise buckle burn burst chip choke corrode crack crumble deform derail drown erode flake fray fuse hang jam mark puncture rip rupture scorch scuff shatter short-circuit snap split suffocate tear warp</div>



<div class="list"> blow up burn down burn up wear away wear down wear out </div>

<p>(ii) In the pattern <span class="pattern">V</span>, these verbs indicate that something breaks or shows damage of some kind. In the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span>, they indicate that something is broken or damaged. The Subject of the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span> may be someone or something that suffers damage to a part of themselves, as in <span class="italics">I fractured my skull</span>, or it may be someone who is responsible for the thing at the time that it is damaged, as in <span class="italics">I crashed my car</span>.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">A couple of fuses <span class="bold"><span class="underline">had blown</span></span>, so I had to trot over the road to Halfords.</span> <span class="example">When I tried to factor in the extra odds, my computer <span class="bold"><span class="underline">blew</span> a fuse</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">When Julie was a baby they had to literally wrap her up in cotton wool to make sure no bones <span class="bold"><span class="underline">broke</span></span>.</span> <span class="example">Suzanne ran anxiously down the path assuming he<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'d broken</span> a leg</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="list"> blow (a fuse or tyre) break (a bone) burn crash crash-land fracture overstretch rupture tear </div>

<span class="pg">481</span> <div class="hd5">1.3 The `dissolve' and `solidify' group</div>
