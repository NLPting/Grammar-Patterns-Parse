05	[1][1]	Prepositional link verbs	Note:	The following combinations of verbs and prepositional phrases can be considered to be link verbs followed by Complements. See the sections on V as n, V to n, etc in Chapter 2.
05	[1][1]	Link verb patterns	Note:	Link verbs have the following patterns. Many of these patterns are dealt with in other chapters because they also occur with verbs that are not link verbs.

05	[1][1][1]	5 V as if, V as though	Note:	The verb is followed by a clause beginning with as if, as though, or, in informal English, like.
05	[1][1][1]	6 V prep	Note:	The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase that describes the Subject and is therefore similar to an adjective in function.
05	[1][1][1]	7 V like n	Note:	The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase consisting of like and a noun group.
05	[1][1][1]	8 V of n	Note:	The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase consisting of of and a noun group.

05	[1][1][1]	11 Link verbs used without a following Complement	Note:	Verbs meaning `seem' can be used by themselves, without a following Complement, in comparative clauses beginning with as or than. This structure is used when you are making a comparison between what someone or something appears to be like and what they are really like.

06	[1][1]	Other verbs with reciprocal meanings	Note:	a) Many verbs not mentioned in this chapter can have a reciprocal meaning. This happens when they are used with a plural Subject and followed by a reciprocal pronoun (each other or one another), as in They hated each other, or by a prepositional phrase containing a reciprocal pronoun, as in They looked at each other. These are not, however, true reciprocal verbs because they cannot be used on their own with a plural Subject, or do not have a reciprocal meaning when they are used like this. For example, you do not say They hated, and if you say They looked, you do not mean that they looked at each other.
06	[1][1]	Reciprocal phrases	Note:	There are a number of phrases which behave like reciprocal verbs and have a reciprocal meaning.

10	[1][1][1][1]	II.1 The `be' group	Note:	These verbs are concerned with something existing or something happening. This is a productive use: any verb which indicates where someone or something is, or how they move, can be used with this pattern, for example Near our camp there flowed a beautiful stream.

11	[1]	1 Auxiliaries
11	[1][1][1]	AUX -ing	Note:	The auxiliary verb be is followed by the `-ing' form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.
11	[1][1][1]	AUX to-inf	Note:	The auxiliary verb be is followed by the to-infinitive form of another verb. The two verbs are in phase and form a complex verb group.
11	[1][1][1]	AUX neg inf	Note:	The auxiliary verb do is followed by the negative not and the bare infinitive form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.
11	[1][1][1]	AUX n inf	Note:	The auxiliary verb do is followed by a noun group and the bare infinitive form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group. The noun group is the Subject.

11	[1][1][1]	AUX -ed	Note:	The auxiliary verb is followed by the `-ed' form of another verb. The auxiliary and the other verb together form the verb group.
11	[1][1][1]	AUX	Note:	The auxiliary verb is used with nothing following it, or with just not following it, when confirming or contradicting a statement, in short answers to questions, or following comparatives. This pattern is used with the auxiliaries be, do and have.
11	[1][1][1]	cl AUX n	Note:	The auxiliary verb follows a clause and is followed by a noun group. The noun group is the Subject of the auxiliary verb. It is usually a personal pronoun.
11	[1][1][1]	so/nor/neither AUX n	Note:	The auxiliary verb follows one of the conjunctions so, nor, or neither and is followed by a noun group. The noun group is the Subject of the auxiliary verb.
11	[1][1][1]	AUX n -ed	Note:	The auxiliary verb had is followed by a noun group and the `-ed' form of another verb. The noun group is the Subject. This pattern is always used with another clause, which comes before or after this one.
11	[2]	2 Modals
11	[2][2][2]	MODAL inf	Note:	The modal verb is followed by the bare infinitive form of another verb. The two verbs together form the verb group. The bare infinitive may be be followed by an `-ed' form or an `-ing' form.
11	[2][2][2]	MODAL have -ed	Note:	The modal verb is followed by have and the `-ed' form of another verb. The three verbs together form the verb group. The `-ed' form may be of the auxiliary verb be, with another verb following it. In this chapter we treat the auxiliary be and the following verb together as the `-ed' form. (See Section 1 above.)
11	[2][2]	Other related patterns	Note:	In addition to the two patterns described above, modal verbs are used in two patterns that are the same as those used with auxiliary verbs.
11	[2][2][2]	MODAL	Note:	The modal verb is used with nothing following it, or with just not following it, when confirming or contradicting a statement, in short answers to questions, or following comparatives. (See AUX inf in Section 1 above.) All the modal verbs except dare and need are used in this pattern.
11	[2][2][2]	cl MODAL n	Note:	The modal verb follows a clause and is followed by a noun group which is the Subject. This forms a tag question. ( See cl AUX n in Section 1 above.) All the modal verbs are used in this pattern.
11	[3]	3 Phrasal modals
11	[3][3][3]	MODAL inf	Note:	The phrasal modal is followed by the bare infinitive of another verb. The phrasal modal and the infinitive together form the verb group.
11	[3][3][3]	MODAL	Note:	The phrasal modal is used with nothing following it, when the verb it refers to is clear from the immediately preceding context.
11	[3][3][3]	MODAL inf than/as inf	Note:	The phrasal modal is followed by the bare infinitive of another verb, than, and the bare infinitive of another verb. In the case of would just as soon, as is used instead of than. The phrasal modal and the two infinitives form a co-ordinated verb group.
11	[3][3][3]	MODAL that	Note:	The phrasal modal is followed by a that-clause. The phrasal modal by itself is the verb group and the that-clause is a new clause, with its own structure.
