<div class="hd0">Chapter 6: Reciprocal Verbs</div>

<p>Reciprocal verbs describe actions or processes in which two or more people, groups, or things do the same thing to each other, have a relationship, or are linked because they are participating jointly in an action or event. Verbs of this kind have the label <span class="pattern">V-RECIP</span> in the Collins Cobuild English Dictionary.</p>

<p>Reciprocal verbs have two basic patterns:</p>

<p>1 They can be used with a plural Subject - that is, a Subject consisting of a <span class="bold">plural noun group</span>. When they are used with this plural Subject, the meaning is that the people, groups, or things involved are interacting with each other. For example, two people can <span class="italics">quarrel</span>, can <span class="italics">have a chat</span>, or can <span class="italics">meet</span>.</p>

<p>2 They can also be used with a Subject which refers to one of the participants and a prepositional Object, Adjunct, or Object which indicates the other participant, as in <span class="italics">She <span class="underline">quarrelled</span> with her sister</span>, <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">had</span> a chat with him</span>, and <span class="italics">I <span class="italics">met</span> him at university</span>. This structure is used to focus on the involvement of the first participant mentioned, or to imply that they have a more active role or greater responsibility for what happens. Usually the action or process is reciprocal even when this structure is used, so <span class="italics">She quarrelled with her sister</span> implies that her sister also quarrelled with her. However, with some verbs and some noun groups, the action or process may not in fact be reciprocal, as when, for example, someone <span class="italics">kisses</span> a baby or a car <span class="italics">collides</span> with a tree: in these instances the baby does not kiss the person and the tree does not collide with the car.</p>

<p>A number of reciprocal verbs can be used with a singular Subject in patterns where the other participant is not mentioned, as in <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">agree</span></span> and <span class="italics">I <span class="italics">was</span> still <span class="italics">negotiating</span> for the best rate</span>. These verbs are listed in the relevant sections in Chapters 1 and 2, for example <span class="pattern">V</span> or <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">for</span> n</span>, and are labelled `also non-recip' in the lists below.</p>

<p>Some verbs are <span class="bold">ergative</span> as well as reciprocal. These verbs are explained and listed separately in <r>Chapter 8</r>.</p>

<div class="hd1">Pattern combinations</div>

<p>A reciprocal verb has one of these three pattern combinations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Pattern combination 1: pl-n V; V <span class="italics">with</span> n<br/><span class="italics">We <span class="underline">quarrelled</span>.</span> <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">quarrelled</span> with his father.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 2: pl-n V n; V n <span class="italics">with</span> n<br/><span class="italics">We <span class="underline">have reached</span> a compromise.</span> <span class="italics">France <span class="underline">has reached</span> a compromise with Britain.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Pattern combination 3: pl-n V; V n<br/><span class="italics">We <span class="underline">embraced</span>.</span> <span class="italics">He <span class="underline">embraced</span> her.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd2">Pattern combination 1: pl-n V; V <span class="italics">with</span> n</div>

<p>These verbs have two patterns:</p>

<li> <span class="pattern">pl-n V</span>: The verb is used with a plural Subject.</li> <span class="pg">456</span> <br/>* <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>: The verb is used with a Subject referring to one participant and followed by a prepositional phrase indicating the other. In most cases, the prepositional phrase consists of <span class="italics">with</span> and a noun group; in a few cases, the preposition is <span class="italics">from</span>, <span class="italics">to</span>, <span class="italics">against</span>, or <span class="italics">into</span>.

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. If the Object comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">talked</span> them <span class="bold">through</span> with a colleague</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">talked through</span> his ideas with a colleague</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">He talked through them with a colleague.</span></p>



<div class="hd2">Pattern combination 3: pl-n V; V n</div>

<p>These verbs have two patterns:</p>

<li> <span class="pattern">pl-n V</span>: The verb is used with a plural Subject.</li> <br/>* <span class="pattern">V n</span>: The verb is used with a Subject referring to one participant and followed by a noun group referring to the other.

<p>Verbs with this combination of patterns belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
<tr><td>3.1 The `kiss' group </td><td>3.2 The `marry' and `divorce' group </td><td>3.3 The `fight' group </td></tr>
</table>

<div class="hd5">3.1 The `kiss' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with affectionate or sexual contact. When these verbs are used with a Subject referring to one participant, the meaning is usually that the other participant does not do the same thing back - the action is not reciprocal. Some informal verbs referring to sexual intercourse also have this pattern.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example"><span class="bold">We <span class="underline">hugged</span></span> and cried.</span> <span class="example">He wanted to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">hug</span> her</span>.</span> </div>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">She gave a fractional smile. <span class="bold">They <span class="underline">kissed</span></span>. She drove away.</span> <span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">kissed</span> me</span> and turned out the light.</span> </div>

<div class="list"> cuddle embrace hug kiss snog </div>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">kiss</span> also has the patterns <span class="pattern">pl-n V n</span> and <span class="pattern">V n n</span>. The noun group which follows the verb, or follows the first noun group, is something such as <span class="italics">goodbye</span> or <span class="italics">goodnight</span>.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example"><span class="bold">They <span class="underline">kissed</span> goodnight</span> before splitting up to avoid photographers who spotted them.</span> <span class="pg">468</span> <span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">kissed</span> me goodnight</span> and then went off to check on something in the kitchen.</span> </div>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">snog</span> also has the pattern <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>: <r>see meaning group 1.3 above</r>.</p>

<div class="hd5">3.2 The `marry' and `divorce' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with marriage, divorce, or romantic relationships.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example"><span class="bold">They <span class="underline">divorced</span></span> in 1976.</span> <span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">divorced</span> her Army husband</span> at 23.</span> <span class="example">The front page of the Sun this morning has a story about a guy who<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'s being divorced</span></span> by his bride because he likes buses.</span> </div>

<div class="list"> court date (also non-recip) divorce (also non-recip) marry (also non-recip) </div>

<div class="hd5">3.3 The `fight' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with fighting or competing.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">When <span class="bold">my brother and I <span class="underline">used to fight</span></span>, Mother would become hysterical and shriek that we were going to kill each other.</span> <span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">had to fight</span> him</span> even though I hate violence.</span> </div>

<div class="hd5">3.4 The `intersect' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that two or more things are in contact. We include here <span class="italics">overlap</span>, where the meaning is metaphorical.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example">As he paused where <span class="bold">the three galleries <span class="underline">intersected</span></span>, another thought occurred to him.</span> <span class="example">It was well after noon and the gas gauge was almost at E before the road <span class="bold"><span class="underline">intersected</span> a larger highway</span>.</span> </div>

<n>In the case of <span class="italics">criss-cross</span>, the noun group following the verb is always a reciprocal pronoun.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The roads here are quite a maze, <span class="bold"><span class="underline">criss-crossing</span> one another</span> in a fashion that at times defies logic.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">with</span> n <span class="italics">about</span> n, V <span class="italics">about</span> n <span class="italics">with</span> n</div>

<p>The prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">with</span> is followed by another prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">about</span> which indicates the topic or issue involved. The prepositional phrases may come the other way round.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I actually <span class="bold"><span class="underline">agree</span> with you about the gun situation</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Talk</span> about it with your partner</span>.</span></li>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">with</span> n <span class="italics">for</span> n, V <span class="italics">for</span> n <span class="italics">with</span> n</div>

<p>The prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">with</span> is followed by another prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">for</span> which indicates what two or more people or groups are trying to get. The prepositional phrases may be the other way round.</p>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">with</span> n <span class="italics">on</span> n, V <span class="italics">on</span> n <span class="italics">with</span> n</div>

<p>The prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">with</span> is followed by another prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">on</span> which indicates the topic or project involved. The prepositional phrases may be the other way round.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Yes, I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">do agree</span> with you on that</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">472</span>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">with</span> n <span class="italics">over</span> n</div>

<p>The prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">with</span> is followed by another prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">over</span> which indicates the topic or issue involved.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He also <span class="bold"><span class="underline">fought</span> with Reagan over cutbacks in social programs</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> argue compromise fight haggle quarrel row squabble wrangle </div>

<div class="hd2">Emphasizing reciprocity</div>

<p>There are three ways of emphasizing the reciprocity of an action or process when using a reciprocal verb with a plural Subject.</p>

<p>a) With most reciprocal verbs, a <span class="bold">reciprocal pronoun</span> (<span class="italics">each other</span> or <span class="italics">one another</span>) can be used after the appropriate preposition or after the verb. These patterns are <span class="pattern">pl-n V <span class="italics">with</span> pron-recip</span> and <span class="pattern">pl-n V pron-recip</span>.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">All across the world today <span class="bold">people <span class="underline">are fighting</span> with each other</span> and killing each other because of their racial and religious differences.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">The fans <span class="underline">would exchange</span> information with one another</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">They <span class="underline">hugged</span> each other</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>b) With a number of reciprocal verbs, a prepositional phrase consisting of <span class="italics">among</span> or <span class="italics">amongst</span> and a plural reflexive pronoun can be used, when there are more than two participants involved. A prepositional phrase consisting of <span class="italics">between</span> and a plural personal pronoun or reflexive pronoun is also sometimes used, and in this case there may be just two participants.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The more <span class="bold">they <span class="underline">argue</span> among themselves</span>, the better.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">Small groups around the room <span class="underline">discussed</span> theories amongst themselves</span>, looking from one suspect to another.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">She tried to persuade him to eat what was left of their food but he couldn't manage it, and so <span class="bold">the driver and Amy <span class="underline">shared</span> it between them</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These patterns most frequently occur with the following verbs:</p>

<div class="list"> agree agree (something) argue battle bicker chat compete confer co-operate debate (something) differ disagree discuss (something) feud fight interact joke make (an agreement) meet quarrel reach (an agreement) resolve (your differences) row settle (your differences) share (something) sign (an agreement) speak squabble swap (things) talk wrangle </div>

<p>c) With a few reciprocal verbs, the adverb <span class="italics">together</span> can be used for emphasis. This pattern is <span class="pattern">pl-n V <span class="italics">together</span></span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">Members of the group <span class="underline">meet</span> together</span> once a week to check their weight, discuss healthy eating and do some exercises.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">They</span> often <span class="bold"><span class="underline">play</span> tennis together</span>, and share a love of Sixties music.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">473</span>
<span class="list" cols="3"> <c sn="3">dance</c> <c sn="2,7">meet</c> <c sn="2">merge</c> <c sn="2">play</c> (a game) <c sn="2,3">share</c> (something) <c sn="1">speak</c> <c sn="2,6">talk</c> </span>

<div class="hd2">Other verbs with reciprocal meanings</div>

<p>a) Many verbs not mentioned in this chapter can have a reciprocal meaning. This happens when they are used with a plural Subject and followed by a reciprocal pronoun (<span class="italics">each other</span> or <span class="italics">one another</span>), as in <span class="italics">They hated each other</span>, or by a prepositional phrase containing a reciprocal pronoun, as in <span class="italics">They looked at each other</span>. These are not, however, true reciprocal verbs because they cannot be used on their own with a plural Subject, or do not have a reciprocal meaning when they are used like this. For example, you do not say <span class="italics">They hated</span>, and if you say <span class="italics">They looked</span>, you do not mean that they looked at each other.</p>

<p>b) Verbs which have the patterns <span class="pattern">V pl-n</span> and <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>, <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">to</span> n</span>, or <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">from</span> n</span> have a reciprocal meaning when they are used in the passive.  For example, two things <span class="italics">can be distinguished</span>, or one thing <span class="italics">can be distinguished from another</span>.</p>

<p>c) Some verbs with the pattern <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">together</span></span> are similar in meaning to reciprocal verbs, but they are not regarded as true reciprocal verbs because they must be followed by the adverb <span class="italics">together</span> when used with a plural Subject. <r>See pages xxx-xxx.</r>  <i>Ch2 Sec3.</i></p>

<div class="hd2">Reciprocal phrases</div>

<p>There are a number of phrases which behave like reciprocal verbs and have a reciprocal meaning.</p>

<p>Most of them consist of a verb and a noun group, and are like the combinations of verbs and noun groups found in Pattern combination 2. A few consist of a verb and a prepositional phrase or an adverbial phrase.</p>

<p>They all have the patterns <span class="pattern">pl-n PHR</span> and <span class="pattern">PHR <span class="italics">with</span> n</span>.</p>

<div class="gx"> <span class="example"><span class="bold">All political parties <span class="underline">should bury the hatchet</span></span> and work together to help drag Australia out of the recession.</span> <span class="example">Kevin Keegan last night <span class="bold"><span class="underline">buried the hatchet</span> with Bobby Robson, the man who upset him so much when he was dropped by England</span>.</span> </div>
